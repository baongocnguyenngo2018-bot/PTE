001. Narration: Three students are discussing the benefits and challenges of working part-time on campus. 
Speaker 1: Hey guys, I was just thinking about how helpful it is to have part-time jobs right here on campus. It really saves a lot of travel time compared to working somewhere else. Plus, it feels like the university gets that we're students first, so they're usually pretty flexible with hours around our classes. It's a big help for managing our studies. 
Speaker 2: Yeah, I totally agree with that, George. The convenience is definitely a big plus. I've heard there are a lot of different kinds of jobs too, like working in the library, in the student cafeteria, or even as a peer tutor. I'm wondering if those types of jobs offer better pay or more useful experience than, say, a retail job downtown. 
Speaker 3: From what I've seen, it really depends on the department, Matilda, but many campus jobs do offer useful experience, especially if you're looking for something that connects with your major. I know a friend who got a job with IT support, and it's been great for their tech skills. Plus, it's a fantastic way to meet new people from different parts of the uni that you wouldn't normally interact with. 
Speaker 1: That's a good point about the experience, Will. But sometimes, even with the flexibility, it can be hard to balance the work. I'm working at the campus bookshop, and during busy times, it can be pretty tough. It just means you have to be super organised with your studies, which isn't always easy when deadlines are piling up. 
Speaker 3: You're right about the workload, George. It definitely takes discipline. I've also heard that some of the more flexible or admin jobs can be pretty competitive to get into because everyone wants those steady, predictable hours. It's not just about finding a job, but finding one that truly fits your schedule without adding too much stress. 
Speaker 2: That's a good point, Will. It sounds like managing your time well and getting through the application process are big hurdles. Maybe it's about being really choosy about the job and how many hours you commit to. I heard some departments offer very flexible, kind of 'one-off' work, like helping with events, which might be less demanding than a regular weekly schedule. 
Speaker 1: You're right about the competition, Matilda. I actually had to apply to a few different places before I got my current job at the bookshop. It felt like applying for a 'real' job, with interviews and everything. But once you're in, it's usually pretty secure and the campus environment is generally much more understanding than an employer from outside. 
Speaker 2: That's good to know, George. So, even with the challenges of balancing studies and the application process, do you both feel like the benefits of working on campus really outweigh the drawbacks? I'm still trying to decide if it's the right move for me, especially with my course load this semester. 
Speaker 3: For me, absolutely. Being financially independent is a huge plus, and as I mentioned, the skills I'm gaining are directly useful for my career path. While it adds to the schedule, the reduced commute and supportive environment make it totally worth it. It’s helped me feel more connected to the university community too. 

002. Narrator: Alina struggles with a tough essay, and Rachel and Daniel guide her with tips and support, boosting her confidence to tackle it step by step. 
Alina: Guys, I'm really struggling with this essay. It's so much more difficult than high school, and I have no idea where to start. It's just overwhelming. 
Rachel : Hey, don't worry too much about it. The first thing you should do is make sure you understand the question. Trying to write without a clear idea of what you're supposed to be discussing will just make things harder. 
Daniel : Yeah. You don't need to start by writing the summary or introduction. Just start with the main content first. Get all your ideas down, and then you can organize them into a logical order later. 
Rachel : That's true. Once you have your main points, you can write a draft and then go back and revise. You might find it easier to write the summary once you've done that. And don't forget, we're here to help, too. We can proofread your draft and give you some feedback. 
Alina : That sounds like a good plan. I feel much better about this now. 
Daniel : The writing center on campus is also a great resource. They can help you brainstorm ideas and even review your essay before you submit it. 
Rachel : Exactly, don’t hesitate to use the resources available to you. And take breaks too when you find yourself stuck. Sometimes stepping away for a bit can help clear your mind and give you a fresh perspective. 
Alina : Yeah, you guys make a lot of sense. I’ll start by understanding the question and then move on from there. And I’ll definitely use the writing center’s help, too. Thank you so much! 
Daniel : You’re welcome! Just remember to take it one step at a time. Writing an essay doesn’t have to be a huge, insurmountable task. You’re capable of breaking it down and conquering it, piece by piece. 
Rachel : Exactly. And remember we’re only a call away. We all struggle at times, but that’s how we learn and grow. You’ve got this! 
Alina : Thanks again. I’ll get started on the outline tonight. Just knowing you guys are here really helps. 
Daniel : Anytime. You’re not alone we’ve all been there. Just keep going, and it’ll get easier with every assignment.

003. Narration: Three students are chatting in the school library after class about how to improve presentation skills. 
Speaker 1: Hey guys, I really feel overwhelmed about the ten-minute presentation next week. I keep worrying I'll blank out in front of the whole class and embarrass myself. I really want to come across as calm and prepared, but I'm scared I'll just freeze up and lose my train of thought. 
Speaker 2: I totally get how you feel presenting can be super intimidating at first. But your tutor is right— the point is to take notes. Also, do not make your speech too long, or your audience will feel bored. And one thing I've learned is that you definitely shouldn't read from the script word by word; it makes you sound like a robot and loses people's attention. Also, something that really helped me was to practice and practice in front of a mirror—it lets you notice your body language and adjust your tone. 
Speaker 3: I used to be nervous, too, especially in middle school my voice would shake every time. One thing that helps me now is I try to avoid the audience's eyes directly; instead, I look at their noses or foreheads so it still seems like I'm engaged. Another tip is to use visual cues on your notes like, you can highlight the script with pens of different colors for different sections. 
Speaker 1: Those are really helpful suggestions thanks, both of you. I've always thought I had to memorize everything perfectly, but focusing on keywords and structure sounds a lot more manageable. Do you think these techniques would help in more formal settings too? 
Speaker 2: Absolutely! In fact, presentation skills are useful after graduation, for example, for an interview—you'll need to present yourself confidently under pressure. It's a very important ability to be confident to express yourself, whether you're pitching a project or just sharing your opinion in a meeting. 
Speaker 3: Yeah, and it's not just about the presentation itself it's also about building self-confidence over time. Maybe we can set up a small practice session together this week? We could take turns giving feedback and trying out different methods. 
Speaker 2: That's a great idea! We could even record each other on our phones—sometimes seeing yourself present helps you notice little things you want to improve. Plus, if we make it a regular thing, we could all become much better speakers by the end of the semester. 
Speaker 3: Exactly! And it doesn't have to be only for big presentations we can practice explaining anything, maybe even topics we're learning in other classes. Who knows, maybe we'll even start enjoying speaking in front of people someday! I think we could start with something low-pressure, like explaining a favorite book or an interesting concept to each other that way it feels more casual and easier to relax. 
Speaker 1: I'd really appreciate that having you two listen and give advice would make me feel a lot more prepared. Let's meet tomorrow after school and run through it a few times. Thanks again, you've already helped me feel less anxious about the whole thing! Also, if you're both okay with it, we could each prepare a short three-minute practice beforehand so we can give more focused feedback during our session tomorrow. 

004. Narration: Three students are discussing the best ways to get to university, each sharing their own experiences, worries and suggestions. 
Speaker 1: I really hate taking the train to university it’s always late, and that’s made me late for class so many times. I’ve been thinking about buying a car lately, but honestly, a car might be way too expensive for me right now. I can barely cover my tuition and rent as it is. 
Speaker 2: Oh, I’ve never had that trouble with buses! I love commuting by bus every morning I take the first bus, which gets me to campus with plenty of time. On the ride, I can prepare for my lectures, go over class materials, read academic articles, or even watch short study videos. Plus, I really enjoy the quietness of the early morning; it helps me calm down before a busy day. Though I have to admit, a bus may be stuck in the traffic sometimes. 
Speaker 3: That traffic issue is real, but cars aren’t the solution either parking on campus is a nightmare, and gas costs add up fast! I live super close to campus, so I just run to school every day. It saves me money and keeps me in shape. Instead of a car, why not try a bicycle? It’s fast enough to get to university on time, and it’s great exercise too. And honestly, I think buses are better than cars. 
Speaker 1: You’re right about buses getting stuck in traffic. I’ve heard so many people complain about that, but since my train is even less reliable, I’m actually willing to try taking the bus. Though I’m still worried—what if the first bus is full and I have to wait for the next one? That might make me late too. 
Speaker 2: Oh, I’ve never had that problem! The first bus at 6 a.m. is usually pretty empty most students don’t want to get up that early. If you leave 10 minutes earlier than me, you can definitely get a seat. And even if the bus is a little slow, you’ll still have time to grab a coffee before class, which is way better than rushing because the train’s late. 
Speaker 3: And if the bus doesn’t work out, the bicycle is still a backup! I used to cycle to school when I lived a little farther away, and I didn’t have to worry about traffic jams. The only downside someone mentioned before is that cycling’s inconvenient on rainy days, but you can keep a foldable umbrella in your bag, or just switch to the bus that day. 
Speaker 1: That makes sense having a backup plan would ease my worry. I think I’ll start with the first bus next week, and if it doesn’t work, I’ll look into buying a second-hand bicycle. It’s way cheaper than a car, and I could use the extra exercise too. 
Speaker 2: Yay, that’s a good call! If you take the 6 a.m. bus, we might even run into each other we can walk to the classroom together after getting off. 
Speaker 3: Perfect! And if you need help picking out a bicycle, just tell me I know a few good shops near campus that sell affordable used ones. No need to spend a lot when you’re just starting out. 

005. Narration: Three students are discussing the accommodation options next academic year 
Speaker 1: Hey guys, I was wondering if you've made any decisions about where you're planning to live next academic year? I know the housing application deadlines are coming up soon, and I'm still trying to weigh my options between staying in university accommodation or finding a private flat. Honestly, I like living in the dormitory because I can learn cooking from other students, share food and make friends. 
Speaker 2: I have to agree with staying in university housing, though for slightly different reasons. The convenience factor is unbeatable - my dorm is literally a three-minute walk from all my lecture halls. When I have 9am classes, I can wake up at eight forty-five and still make it on time 
Speaker 3: Actually, I just signed a contract yesterday for a studio apartment in the city center, and I couldn't be more relieved! After a full year in the noisy dormitory, I'm really looking forward to having my own quiet space. What I hated most about dorm life was the constant disturbance - people coming and going at all hours, loud music in the evenings, and the worst part was definitely sharing kitchen facilities 
Speaker 1: That's interesting because my experience has been completely the opposite! I've actually grown to love dormitory living, especially because of the shared kitchen. Cooking has always been my passion, and I've found it's such a wonderful way to connect with people from different cultures. Just last week, my French roommate taught me how to make authentic crêpes, and in return I showed her some traditional dishes from my country. 
Speaker 3: I'm quite particular about my food, and it drove me crazy when people would help themselves to things from my shelf in the fridge. This new place is slightly more expensive, but for me, having that privacy and peace is absolutely worth the extra cost. Also in the dormitory I have little personal privacy, where I have to share the kitchen and someone else steals my food, like drinking my milk, eating my food. 
Speaker 2: And it’s not just about convenience for me. During exam periods last semester, we organized nightly study groups in the common room where we could quiz each other and explain difficult concepts. That collaborative environment really helped boost my grades in ways I don't think would have happened if I was living alone off-campus. 
Speaker 1: That’s exactly why the shared kitchen feels so special to me. Those spontaneous cooking sessions often turn into great conversations where we learn so much about each other's backgrounds. For me, that cultural exchange is one of the most valuable parts of university life that I'd miss in private accommodation. 
Speaker 3: Speaking of dorm downsides, noise is a huge one for me. It makes me hard to focus on study. So, I have rented an off-campus room and have signed the contract. But the place I've found is just a little far from the university. 
Speaker 2: You two have covered culture and quiet - let me loop back to academics for a second. But more importantly, I've found the academic support system invaluable. The dorm has a study lounge on each floor, and there's always someone around to bounce ideas off. 

006. Narration: Three students are discussing their project meeting place on campus. 
Speaker 1: I think we should meet in a conference room in the university library. We can conveniently borrow books we need right there while we work. It's a quiet space with plenty of resources, and we won't have to carry heavy books around later. Plus, the library has those small study rooms we can book if we need complete privacy. 
Speaker 2: I'm not so sure about that idea the library is always so crowded during this time of day. There will be too many people studying and chatting outside the rooms, and it will be very noisy even inside the conference areas. Last time I tried to study there, I could hardly concentrate with all the distractions. Maybe we should consider someplace else that's actually quiet. 
Speaker 3: I have a compromise we can go to the library first to borrow all the books we need for our research. Then, we can move to a coffee shop to sit down and assign tasks to each other properly. If we run into any issues later or can't meet in person, we can always continue our discussion online. This way we get the resources we need and a comfortable space to talk. 
Speaker 1: That's actually a smart plan. Which coffee shop were you thinking about? There are several near campus, but most tend to be quite busy in the afternoons. I remember the one near the south gate has good space, but it's always packed with students. Maybe we should look for someplace less popular? 
Speaker 2: I like the idea, but I have to go back home around 4 PM to receive a package that's being delivered. I don't want to miss it since it's something important for the project. I can join you guys after that, though it might make me a little late for the meeting. Would it be okay if I catch up with you both later? 
Speaker 3: That should be fine. Just remember to call us when you go out of home so we know when to expect you. We can start without you and fill you in when you arrive. If anything urgent comes up, we can always hop on a quick online call to keep you in the loop. 
Speaker 1: Sounds good! Now back to picking a coffee shop I've been to almost all of them around here, and most do have too many people during this time. What about that new place called "Honey Cup"? It's a bit farther from campus, but I heard they have amazing pastries and plenty of seating. 
Speaker 2: I've passed by Honey Cup a few times it does look cozy, and they have those big booths at the back. More importantly, it usually has fewer people compared to chains like Starbucks. Plus, who can say no to sweet treats while working, right? 
Speaker 3: Great, then it's settled! We'll meet at the library at 3 PM, get our books, then walk over to Honey Cup to assign tasks and discuss the project outline. Don't forget to call us when you're on your way! 

007. Narration: Three students are talking about their volunteering experiences. 
Speaker 1: Hey, everyone. I can't believe how quickly this semester is flying by. I've been super busy with my role as an orientation leader at the university. I have to invest time and effort in planning and organizing events for new students. The good part is that I get to meet so many new people and help them learn about university life, which is really fulfilling. On the downside, it can be a bit stressful, especially during orientation week, when everything needs to run smoothly. But it's worth it because it helps me develop my leadership and public speaking skills. What about you, Amy? How's volunteering at the library going? 
Speaker 2: Well, it has its own set of challenges and rewards. I really enjoy the organizational aspect of it. I've gained valuable skills in cataloguing and event planning, and I feel like I'm giving something back to the community. But some of the tasks like putting books on shelves and data entry can get pretty boring. And standing for long periods isn't great either. 
Speaker 3: I get that. Working at the animal shelter takes a lot of physical energy and time, which can sometimes be so tiring. But the best part is interacting with the animals, and knowing that I'm making a difference in their lives. But it can also be emotionally difficult, especially when you see animals who have been through a lot. 
Speaker 1: It's clear you're passionate about what you do, Sam. One thing I found is that being an orientation leader has made me more adaptable. Every group of students is different, and you have to be ready to handle any situation that comes up. I think these skills will be invaluable in my future career. 
Speaker 2: That's a great point, Alex. Volunteering at the library has definitely made me better at problem solving. Whenever someone needs help with finding a source of information in some specialist area, it's like a little puzzle that I have to solve. So I think it's made me more analytical and improved my problem solving skills, which will come in useful in practically any job I pursue in the future. 
Speaker 3: It's interesting to hear how we've all developed different skills from our volunteering experiences. For me, the animal shelter work has made me much better at multitasking. There are always so many things happening at once, and you need to stay calm and collected. It's also taught me a lot about teamwork as we all need to work together to ensure the animals are well taking care of. And I get to work with a variety of personalities. 
Speaker 1: Absolutely. I think volunteering, no matter where or what you do, involves a lot of teamwork. At the end of the day, it's about investing time and effort in something you're passionate about and gaining invaluable skills from it. Plus, it feels great to give back to the community. 
Speaker 3: Let's just hope we'll be able to find time to do this next semester too. Managing my time around coursework and volunteering can be tricky. 

008. Narration: Three teachers are discussing how to celebrate the mathematics department's ten-year anniversary. 
Speaker 1: For our mathematics department's 10th anniversary, I think the Greek restaurant downtown is a good option. It has been most recommended by customers around the city, and people always say the atmosphere there is really enjoyable. I believe it will be memorable for all of us to spend such an important anniversary there! They even have a private room that could accommodate our entire department perfectly. 
Speaker 2: I have also heard about the Greek restaurant's popularity, but it may be quite expensive for us. And it's so far from campus that colleagues might find it inconvenient to get there after work. Maybe we should celebrate the anniversary on campus instead? It would be more budget-friendly and accessible for everyone here, especially for those who have evening classes or other commitments. 
Speaker 1: Okay, but never in the mathematics building restaurant, though the space is too cramped, and its outdated decor is so dull. I can't imagine our cheerful celebration would happen in that place. Anywhere else is fine, as long as it provides a proper celebratory atmosphere for this special milestone. 
Speaker 3: What about the Business Building's dining room? It's spacious enough for us to arrange the catering, and it's recently renovated in a modern style, offering intoxicating vibes. The natural lighting and city view from there would create a wonderful backdrop for our celebration. 
Speaker 2: Great. That's a wonderful place. Now, how many people should we invite? I previously thought about faculty members only, but it might be too small an occasion. We should consider making this a proper celebration that reflects our department's growth and achievements over the past decade. 
Speaker 1: So, why not invite alumni who graduated from our department to come? They also witnessed our early years, and the ten-year anniversary is meaningful to them as well. If the space is too limited for too many people, we can only invite the first graduating students, as they would appreciate this milestone the most. 
Speaker 3: But what if they want to bring a partner? We need to establish a clear policy about plus-ones to ensure we don't exceed the room's capacity and maintain the intimate atmosphere we're hoping to create. 
Speaker 1: I bet they'll definitely have a lot to talk about with each other, so they may not come with a partner, and besides, their partners might easily get bored in such an event. Keeping it to just our mathematics community will help everyone feel more comfortable sharing memories and stories. 
Speaker 3: Well, I agree with you. So, a mix of current faculty and selected alumni. I will book the dining room as soon as possible, and you two can prepare the guest list together. Let's aim to have the preliminary list ready by next week so we can start sending out invitations. 

009. Narration: Three students are discussing managing written assignments. 
Speaker1: Lately, when I’ve been working on my assignments, I find it really hard to organize everything. I feel a lot of pressure, and even when I try to write a goal, I just cannot stick to it. Do you guys ever deal with this situation? How do you usually cope? 
Speaker2: Oh, I totally get you. I’ve been there. What helped me before was breaking those lengthy assignments into smaller ones. For example, if the due date is still pretty long, I’ll first make a plan, then create an outline, and finally schedule everything step by step. 
Speaker3: Yeah, I do something similar, pretty much the same approach. And if I have different assignments at the same time, I try to allocate different amounts of time to each one, depending on how urgent or difficult they are. 
Speaker1: I've actually tried to do that too, but the problem is I never do it consistently. I always end up losing momentum halfway or getting sidetracked by other things, and then the whole plan falls apart. Maybe what I’m really missing is some kind of external structure or immediate accountability. 
Speaker2: That's the tricky part. If you let yourself get distracted, the whole thing will take longer. You really need to avoid things like mobile phones, TV, emails, and just try to focus. By the way, do you two have a specific time for study? Like a fixed routine, maybe in the morning or evening? 
Speaker3: For me, I work best at night. Of course, everyone is different, but I think the most important thing is to study when you feel the most productive. Personally, I usually write essays in the evening after dinner, so that's when I focus. 
Speaker1: Hmm, I’m still not sure what works best for me. But I think the most important thing is to have a work buddy. It really helps when someone else knows your goals and checks in on you it adds a sense of responsibility and support that I often miss when working alone. 
Speaker2: Exactly! Why don’t we just do the next assignment together? That way, we can plan together, keep each other motivated, and also practice as a group. We could even set up weekly check-ins to share progress and adjust our plans if something isn’t working. Having a structured yet flexible approach might help us all stay on track. 
Speaker3: That sounds like a great idea. Having a study group not only keeps us accountable but also allows us to share ideas and feedback in real time. We could even set mini-deadlines for each stage of the assignment and review each other’s progress. It’s easier to stay consistent when you’re not doing it alone. Plus, collaborating early helps avoid last-minute stress and improves the overall quality of our work—everyone brings something different to the table. 

010. Narration: Three students are walking to the gym for their PE class, discussing whether the school should cancel the PE proficiency test as a graduation requirement. 
Speaker1: Ugh, I’m so stressed about the upcoming 1000-meter run test! No matter how much I practice, I can never meet the passing standard. Why should I risk not graduating just because I’m not good at running? 
Speaker2: I totally agree! I have a knee injury from last year’s basketball game, and even walking for a long time hurts, let alone running or doing pull-ups. If it’s no longer a graduation requirement, students with injuries or physical limitations won’t have to worry about their academic future being affected by something they can’t control. 
Speaker3: Wait, hold on I don’t think canceling the PE proficiency test is a good idea. PE class is supposed to encourage us to stay active, and the test is a way to make sure we’re keeping up with basic fitness. Without it, a lot of students would just skip PE and become less healthy, which isn’t good for our long-term well-being. 
Speaker1: But the test doesn’t encourage fitness it just makes people anxious! I have a friend who starved herself for a week before the weight and BMI test because she was scared of failing. That way, we stay active without the stress of passing a strict test. 
Speaker2: Yeah, and not everyone is good at traditional sports like running or swimming. I love dancing, and I practice it every weekend, but the PE test doesn’t count that as fitness. Also, the test only checks one moment of fitness, not our overall lifestyle what’s the point of that? 
Speaker3: But basic fitness is important for everyone, even if you don’t like sports. Being able to run a short distance or do a few push-ups helps with daily life like carrying heavy books or walking up stairs. And if the school makes exceptions for students with injuries, like letting them do modified exercises, then the test can still work without being unfair. 
Speaker1: Hmm, I get what you’re saying about basic fitness, but exceptions are hard to get. Maybe the school could replace the proficiency test with a “fitness portfolio” we track our own physical activities over the semester, like how many times we work out, and get credit for consistency instead of a single test. 
Speaker2: That’s a great idea! A fitness portfolio would let us choose what activities we like, and it focuses on effort instead of results. Also, it teaches us to be responsible for our own fitness, which is a better lesson than just passing a test. 
Speaker3: Okay, that does sound more reasonable than just canceling the test entirely. The school could ask us to submit photos or videos of our workouts, or have PE teachers check in with us regularly. If they do that, then the portfolio could work as a fair replacement. 

011. Narrator: Two students and one admin staff member are discussing whether universities should provide free access to public transportation for students. 
Student 1: Do you think universities should offer free access to public transportation for all students? It would make commuting more affordable, especially for those living off campus. Many students already face financial stress, and covering daily travel costs on top of tuition and living expenses adds to the burden. 
Student 2: I completely agree. Free public transport could also encourage more sustainable habits. Instead of driving cars or relying on ride shares, students might opt for buses and trains, which helps reduce traffic congestion and lowers the university's overall carbon footprint. It's a win-win for students and the environment. 
Admin Staff: It's certainly an appealing idea. But implementing such a scheme would require strong partnerships between the university and local transportation authorities. Negotiating subsidies or bulk discounts isn't easy, and the cost implications for the institution could be significant. 
Student 1: That's true, but some universities in other countries have managed it by integrating transportation fees into student services charges. It spreads out the cost, and no individual student feels a huge impact. And it provides equitable access for everyone. 
Student 2: And let's not forget accessibility. Free transportation means students from lower-income households won't have to limit their course choices based on proximity or face difficulties attending evening lectures, internships, or campus events. It helps level the playing field. 
Admin Staff: Those are good points. However, we'd also need to assess usage patterns. Some students live within walking distance or cycle to campus, so they may not benefit directly from such a program. Offering an opt-in system could be one way to balance fairness with feasibility. 
Student 1: Or perhaps the university could negotiate partial discounts instead of full coverage. Even a 50% reduction on fares would make a big difference for many students and still promote public transportation. 
Admin Staff: That would certainly provide useful data. It's also worth considering how this initiative could align with broader university goals, like promoting sustainability and enhancing students' well-being. 
Student 1: Ultimately, making public transportation free or more affordable isn't just a convenience. It's an investment in creating an inclusive and environmentally conscious campus community. 
Student 2: Exactly. Supporting students with their commuting needs shows the university is serious about removing barriers to education and improving their overall experience. 
Admin Staff: If implemented carefully, this initiative could serve as a model for other institutions, demonstrating how universities can partner with local governments to support students and the wider community. 

012. Narration: Three students are debating the value of required physical education courses 
Speaker 1: I can't believe we're forced to take two semesters of PE. I tried badminton last term and it was so humiliating. I have zero coordination. The coach kept correcting my posture in front of everyone. I'd rather use that time for my major courses instead of wasting afternoons running around a court. 
Speaker 2: Actually, I think PE requirements are pretty valuable. Before college, I never exercised regularly. Now, because it's mandatory, I've discovered I actually enjoy swimming. It's a great stress reliever from all the academic pressure. Plus, it gets me away from my desk and screens for a few hours each week. 
Speaker 3: That's fine for you, but not everyone enjoys competitive activities. I have asthma and always struggle to pass the fitness tests. Last semester I got docked points because I couldn't complete the running requirement. It's unfair to judge everyone by the same physical standards when we have different abilities and health conditions. 
Speaker 1: Exactly! And the grading is so subjective. Why should my GPA suffer because I'm not athletic? I'm here to get an education, not train for the Olympics. The time spent changing clothes, showering, and traveling to the sports complex adds over three hours to my weekly schedule time I could use studying. 
Speaker 2: I understand your concerns, but that's missing the bigger picture. We sit in classrooms and libraries all day. PE forces us to maintain some physical activity, which actually improves concentration and sleep quality. I've noticed I focus better on readings after some exercise. And it's not about being the best it's about participation and basic health awareness. 
Speaker 3: But why make it graded then? If it's about health benefits, it should be pass/fail without affecting our transcripts. I'd be less opposed if it wasn't impacting my academic standing. The current system causes unnecessary anxiety for those of us who aren't naturally sporty. 
Speaker 1: Same here! At least make it optional or offer more alternatives like yoga or walking clubs that accommodate different fitness levels. The one-size-fits-all approach just doesn't work. 
Speaker 2: I agree there should be more options, but I still think some physical activity requirement is important. Many students would never exercise otherwise. Maybe they could expand the choices to include less intensive activities. 
Speaker 3: I'd support that compromise. If they offered activities like hiking or dance without the competitive element, I might actually enjoy it. But the current system needs reform—it's too rigid and stressful for non-athletes. 

013. Narration: Three students are discussing what they feel about a course. 
Speaker 1: Ugh, I don't know about you guys, but I think today's lecture was way too hard. The professor kept jumping between different theories, and I could barely keep up with what he was saying. By the time he started explaining that third concept, my notes were just a jumble of scribbles. I even missed the part about next week's quiz. 
Speaker 2: Yeah, I get what you mean. But honestly, I think it gets easier if you go through the reading list first. The professor mentioned those books for a reason. If you read them before class, the lecture makes a lot more sense. 
Speaker 1: Hmm, maybe. But the reading list is so long there are like seven books and four articles! I don't even know where to start. Do I need to read every single page, or is there a way to pick out the important parts? 
Speaker 3: Well, actually, it's pretty easy to find those books on the library website. They usually have all the course readings listed there, organized by week, and you can just search by title. Oh, and most of them have PDF previews, so you can flip through the contents to see which chapters the professor highlighted. 
Speaker 1: Oh, really? I didn't know that. I’ve been wasting time scrolling through random websites trying to find summaries. Most of them are either too vague or don't match what the professor talked about. I should have checked the library first instead of struggling with those. 
Speaker 3: It’s totally fine - half the class didn’t realize the library had all this stuff at first. If you get stuck, the librarian is super helpful. Last week, I couldn't find one of the recommended articles, and she showed me exactly how to access it online. She taught me how to use the library’s archive database, and we found it in five minutes. She even printed out the key sections for me. 
Speaker 2: With the library and the librarian helping find reading materials, doesn't that just show how important the reading list is? See? That's why I keep saying the reading list is your best friend. If you read ahead, you're not going in blind during the lecture. And trust me, once you've read them, the lecture won't feel half as hard. 
Speaker 1: Okay, you've convinced me. I was skeptical at first, but hearing you both talk about it makes sense. If the library’s that easy to use and the reading list actually lines up with the lectures, I'll try checking the library website tonight, and maybe talk to the librarian if I get lost. Sounds like she knows her stuff. I'm willing to give it a shot. 
Speaker 3: Good plan. Once you get the hang of it, finding the readings is pretty quick. I used to spend hours stressing over it, but now I can pull up what I need in 10 minutes. Also you can bookmark the course page so you don’t have to hunt for it every time. 

014. Narration: Three students are discussing whether they should take part in a field trip organized by the university. 
Speaker 1: Honestly, my part-time shifts conflict with the field trip, and it will cost me a lot of money. But even if I take the day off, the lost wages would set me back more than I can afford right now. So I think I'll have to sit this one out. After all, the trip is just an optional one. 
Speaker 2: You are right, optional. But I will definitely go. The trip will be so great for all people. Business majors can visit a hotel by sea to see how it is run. Those who major in geography will be glad to see a beach and I believe the beach cleanup activity will attract them. I am a history major and the field trip includes a history museum, which ties perfectly into my research on maritime trade. So, why miss out on a free trip with friends? 
Speaker 1: Let me think twice. A free trip with a lot of friends? I have to admit it will definitely a great chance to socialize. You know, I’ve been wanting to meet more people outside my major. Maybe I'll see if I can swap my work shift my coworker owes me a favor, so fingers crossed! 
Speaker 3: I won't go, either. Although I am from the business department, I see no point for business students to go so far just to visit a seashore hotel. Hotels are almost everywhere in the city, aren't they? A seashore one won't make any difference. Isn't it just a glorified ad for the resort sponsor? 
Speaker 2: All the same as hotels in the city? I am afraid not. In fact a hotel by sea involves very different management than the urban counterparts, and you can imagine guests on the beach will raise many different requests to the hotel. So you can learn a new style of hotel management. 
Speaker 3: You are so persuasive and now I'd love to, but I will have a very, very important football match that weekend to take part in. I am one of the team's starters, so my absence would drive the coach and my teammates mad. You don't know how long and how hard all of us have been preparing for the match. 
Speaker 2: I see your point. However, I really hope you can reconsider the field trip and join us. Besides the hotel will help you a lot on your major, don't forget the history museum I just mentioned. I hear the museum has a wonderful sports history section. Didn't you say your team's researching athlete nutrition trends? You could totally find relevant archives or old studies there, and that could even give your team an edge! 
Speaker 3: Well, the sports history section does sound interesting our coach has been pushing us to study past training methods lately. But the football tournament is a big deal for our team; we’ve been practicing for months. I'll think about it, but don't get your hopes up! 
Speaker 1: Hmm. Okay, now you guys have got me tempted. Everyone keeps saying the beach cleanup activity is a good icebreaker among people from different departments. Plus, I've never been to that history museum, and it might be a nice change from my usual routine. But no promises! 

015. Narration: Joe prefers on-campus, Emily chooses independence off-campus, Barista reminds decisions due next week. 
Barista: The people at the accommodation office wanted to know who is coming by to live on campus next year. We got to let them know for sure by next week. It sounds like most people are coming back. What are you guys going to do? Have you decided yet? 
Joe: Really? They need to know so soon. Well, I have already decided. I am coming back next year, I think on-campus accommodation provides a better atmosphere for studying. 
Emily: Honestly, I've been considering living outside. I think I would prefer a bit more independence. Plus I've found an affordable place that is pretty close to campus. Plus, I think living off campus could be a good way to experience more of the city. 
Joe: Really, Emily? I hadn't heard you made a decision. That's interesting. Well, those are both good points. I'm kind of torn between the convenience of living on campus, and the independence of living off-campus. 
Emily: Hey, why don't you make a list of pros and cons? That might help you in your decision-making. Or you could just flip a coin, Joe. But really, think about what will make your life easier and happier. Consider the cost, travel time, studies, and distractions in both scenarios. 
Barista: Interesting! I will keep these points in mind when submitting the response. Whatever the case, everyone needs to make up their mind by next week for sure. 
Joe: Sure, I've made up my mind. 
Emily: Same here. I feel good about my choice too. 
Barista: That’s great. Honestly, what matters most is choosing what works best for your lifestyle. And even if you two live in different places, you’ll still see each other every day on campus. 
Joe: Exactly. We can still study together or hang out at the café. 
Emily: And who knows, maybe one day I’ll even miss the campus life and come back. 
Barista: (laughs) Well, nothing is permanent. The good thing is you both sound confident in your choices now. 
Joe: Yeah, and either way, next year is going to be an exciting one. 
Emily: Absolutely, I’m really looking forward to it. 

016. Narration: Three students are discussing finding a job after graduation. 
Speaker 1: Hey guys, have you thought about what you want to do after graduation? I've been researching job opportunities, and I'm leaning toward joining a big company. The structured training programs they offer seem really valuable for professional development, not to mention the clear promotion paths. I think starting in a well-established organization could really set the foundation for a successful career. 
Speaker 2: That's interesting! I’ve actually been volunteering at a small charity organization, and I've really enjoyed the experience. For me, success isn't about climbing the corporate ladder or earning a high salary. I find the work meaningful, and the environment is so supportive. I might even consider staying in the non-profit sector after graduation. 
Speaker 3: Wow, you both already have such clear plans! I'm still figuring things out. To be honest, I'm thinking about staying here to pursue a postgraduate degree. I feel like I have time to explore my options, and further study might help me narrow down what I really want to do. 
Speaker 1: That's fair, but it's still good to start planning early. Maybe you could try out different jobs or internships while you’re studying? That way, you can get a sense of what you enjoy or what you're good at before committing to a specific path. 
Speaker 2: I agree! Keeping an open mind and gaining diverse experiences can be really helpful. What you do now doesn't have to define your future career - it’s more about exploring and learning about yourself. Plus, you might discover unexpected passions along the way. 
Speaker 3: You've both given me a lot to think about. I think I'll start doing some research tonight and maybe look into part-time work or internships. It’s nice to know I don't have to figure this all out alone. 
Speaker 1: No problem at all! If you need help sifting through internship postings, just let me know. I've got a folder full of resources for different industries - tech, finance, even some creative fields. And hey, if you find something that sparks your interest, we can brainstorm how to tailor your application to stand out. 
Speaker 2: That's a great offer! I can chime in too nonprofits have unique application quirks, like emphasizing passion over past experience. I've learned a lot about writing cover letters that connect personal stories to an organization's mission. Plus, if you want to dip a toe into the nonprofit world, I can introduce you to the team at my charity - they're always looking for extra help on weekends. 
Speaker 3: You guys are the best. Having a starting point and people to bounce ideas off of makes this feel way less overwhelming. Let me start with that research tonight and I’ll loop you both in with what I find. Thanks for the advice! 

017. Narration: Three students are discussing the pros and cons of online classes, sitting around a small table in the campus cafeteria, their voices mixing with the background chatter of other students. 
Speaker1: I really can't stand online classes. The Wi-Fi would also cut out randomly during that economics lecture last week, making the slides freeze constantly. Last week during my economics lecture, I kept getting distracted by my phone and ended up missing half the content. And when I tried to ask a question in the chat, the professor didn't see it until the next day! 
Speaker2: Actually, I prefer online learning. Think about it - no more rushing to catch the 8am bus, no spending money on cafeteria food, and I can attend class in my pajamas. I just open my notebook and focus on taking notes. The lack of physical distractions in my own space helps me concentrate better too. The recorded lectures are great too - I can rewatch difficult parts anytime. 
Speaker3: But that's exactly the problem! I chose this university for the campus experience. How am I supposed to make friends or network if we're all just little boxes on a screen? And when I type a question, by the time the professor responds, we've already moved on to another topic. It's like the conversation gets lost in the digital void. 
Speaker1: Exactly! In physical classes, I can just raise my hand and get immediate answers. Plus, group discussions are so much more engaging in person. There's no substitute for the energy of debating ideas face - to - face, with everyone's gestures and tones adding to the discussion. Online breakout rooms always feel awkward and unproductive. 
Speaker2: I get your point about socializing, but consider the flexibility. I can review lecture recordings while eating dinner, or study in my comfortable room instead of those hard library chairs. And I don't have to worry about looking presentable for class, which takes off a lot of social pressure. And honestly, I find I actually participate more online - I'm too shy to speak up in big lecture halls. 
Speaker3: That might work for you, but I learn better through face - to - face interactions. Body language and classroom energy help me understand the material. Last semester I failed a course because the online format just didn't work for my learning style. 
Speaker1: Same here! At least in physical classes, the professor can see when students look confused. Online, they just keep lecturing to blank screens. Maybe a hybrid system would be better - some online, some in - person classes? It would balance the need for interaction and flexibility, don't you think? 
Speaker2: That could be a good compromise. We'd get the benefits of both formats. Though I'd still prefer fully online - it saves me nearly two hours of commuting every day. Those two hours add up to extra sleep or more time for self - study, which is a huge plus for me. 
Speaker3: Well, I'd take hybrid over fully online any day. At least that way I could still get some of the campus experience. But honestly, I think education should be primarily in-person - that's what university is all about. 

018. Narration: Three students are preparing for an oral presentation and discussing structure, practice, and Q&A strategies. 
Speaker 1: Okay, so we're all set for our presentation next week, right? I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed, to be honest. I’ve started drafting my slides, but I’m not sure if I’m focusing on the right things, you know? I'm also worried about the time limit; it’s tough to get everything into just ten minutes. Has anyone got any tips for, like, how to structure it well? 
Speaker 2: Definitely! I think the key thing is to start with a really good opening that grabs everyone's attention. Then, break your main points down into smaller chunks, easier to handle. Don't try to put too much stuff on each slide. I think using visuals, like graphs or images, really helps keep people interested. And the most important thing is practice, practice! You don't want to be, like, stumbling over your words on the day. 
Speaker 3: I agree with Liam about practicing for sure. I usually record myself giving the presentation, and then I watch it back to see where I can make it better. It’s awful, but it really does help! For the content, I think it's good to start by outlining your main arguments, even before you make the slides. What’s the main thing you're trying to say? It's easy to get lost in the details, but that'll help you stay on track. 
Speaker 1: That’s a really good idea, Laura, about doing the outline first. I usually just jump right into the details and then I have trouble making it all make sense together. I'm also a bit nervous about the Q&A part afterwards. What if I don’t know an answer? Any ideas on how to get ready for that? 
Speaker 2: The Q&A is tricky, but you can get ready! Think about the questions people might ask and have some answers ready, even if they're just rough. It’s also okay to say you don’t know, but you’ll find out. Being honest is always best. Just try to, like, engage with them and show that you're thinking about the topic. Don't freak out if you get stuck; it happens to everyone! 
Speaker 3: I actually think the Q&A is the most fun! It's a chance to really talk with the audience and show how much you care about the topic. Going along with what Liam said, it's totally fine to say, 'That's a great question, but I don't really have a good answer right now.' You could even ask the audience what they think. It's a conversation, not, like, a test! 
Speaker 1: Okay, I feel a bit better now. Thanks, you two! I think I’ll try to make a really good outline and practice how I'm going to say it. I'll also try to think of some questions they might ask, but I won't worry about it too much. I guess the main thing is to be ready, but also be able to change if I need to and, you know, enjoy it. That's easier said than done, though! 
Speaker 2: You've got this, Sarah! We're all in the same boat. Just remember to breathe and try to have fun. It's a great chance to share what you know and get some feedback. Plus, giving presentations is a really good skill to have for jobs later, so think of it as practice for after university! 
Speaker 3: Exactly! And don't be afraid to ask for help if you need it. We can all practice our presentations together and, like, give each other feedback. It's much easier when you know people are there for you. Let’s try to meet up again before the presentation to go over everything one last time. 

019. Narration: Three students are discussing and comparing different note-taking methods used at university lectures. 
Speaker 1: So, I've been trying out different ways to take notes lately, and I'm not really sure which one works best. I tried the Cornell method, but it feels a little too structured for me, you know? What about you guys, what do you usually do? 
Speaker 2: I'm a big fan of mind mapping, actually. It really helps me see how all the ideas connect and get the bigger picture. I usually start with the main idea in the middle and then branch out from there. Plus, it's not as linear as regular note-taking, which keeps me way more interested. It’s especially helpful in subjects where things are really connected, like history or philosophy. 
Speaker 3: I’ve tried mind mapping before, but I think it’s a bit messy, to be honest. I usually prefer outlining. It’s just simple and easy, and it helps me keep everything organized logically. I use different headings and subheadings to structure my notes, which makes it easy to look back at them later. 
Speaker 1: Yeah, I get why you'd like outlining, but sometimes I feel like I'm just writing down exactly what the professor says without really thinking about it. With the Cornell method, I have to sum things up and think about what it all means, which helps me understand it better. Maybe I should give it another shot. 
Speaker 2: That's a good point, Sarah. I think the main thing is to find what works for you and the subject you're studying. Like, I use mind mapping when we're brainstorming in my creative writing class, but I switch to something more straightforward for statistics. Different subjects need different things, don't you think? 
Speaker 3: Definitely. I also think it helps to mix and match different methods. For example, I might use outlining to structure my notes, but then add colors or symbols to make them more interesting. Or, I might use the Cornell method in lectures, but then just take freehand notes when we're having group discussions. 
Speaker 1: That's a great idea, Alice! I hadn’t even thought about doing that. Maybe that's what I'm missing – being able to change my note-taking depending on what's going on. I'll try to be more open to trying new things and see what works best for each class. It might also help if I looked at my notes more often to really remember what I've learned. 
Speaker 2: Exactly! Don’t be afraid to play around with your method until it feels right. I’ve even seen people using note-taking apps that let you type, draw, and record audio all in one place. Whatever helps you understand and remember things, right? It's all about finding the right tools for how you learn best. 
Speaker 3: Agreed. And don't forget how important it is to really listen. No matter what you're doing with your notes, it's important to pay attention during the lecture or discussion. That way, your notes will make more sense and be easier to remember later. I think we all need to experiment a bit to find what works best for us. 

020. Narration: Three students are discussing how AI in writing is changing learning and teaching methods. 
Speaker 1: I'm still thinking about that debate on AI in academic writing. I mean, the main point about things being real really stuck with me. If students can just get essays from AI, how do we know what they actually understand? It feels like it ruins the whole idea of showing what you know and how you can think for yourself. 
Speaker 2: That's a really good point, Sarah. I saw a lot of students agreeing with that. But I think the debate also showed how AI could be a useful tool, not just a shortcut. Like, for people who don't speak English as their first language, or those with learning difficulties, it could be a really good grammar checker or a brainstorming partner. So, it could make things fairer in some ways. 
Speaker 3: I agree with Professor Roger on that. The point about making things easier for everyone was really strong. I also thought the idea about AI giving you more time for deeper research was interesting. If you're not spending ages on basic sentences, you could really get into more complex analysis, couldn't you? 
Speaker 1: But that's where I get a bit stuck, Aria. If students aren't doing the hard work of putting sentences together or finding the right words, are they really learning to communicate well? It feels like we're getting someone else to do the very process that helps us think critically. I worry it could make people lazy thinkers. 
Speaker 2: I get that worry, Sarah. It's a real problem for teachers. Maybe the answer isn't to just ban AI, but to change our assignments. We could get students to do more original research, or come up with unique arguments that AI can't just make up. Or even have them look at AI-made content and say what's good or bad about it. That would actually help them learn to think critically about things. 
Speaker 3: That makes a lot of sense, Professor. Like, in my history class, we're already doing oral presentations and debates. AI can't really help with talking and thinking on the spot. Maybe assignments should move towards things where you have to put ideas together and think originally right away, instead of just written essays. 
Speaker 1: That sounds good, but I'm still wondering about the practical side. How would professors tell the difference between using AI in a good way and just outright cheating? And what about students who can't afford to pay for good AI tools? It could create a new kind of unfairness with technology. 
Speaker 2: Those are big problems, Sarah, and the debate definitely didn't have easy answers. It's a talk we'll need to keep having as technology changes. Universities will need clear rules, and we'll have to think about making sure everyone has fair access to these tools if we expect students to use them correctly. 
Speaker 3: Exactly. What I think is most important is that it's not really about 'if' AI is used, but 'how' it's used. We can't stop it now, so we just need to figure out how to use it in a good way. It's definitely going to change how we learn and how we're taught. 

021. Narrator: Three students are discussing how universities can promote sustainable transportation. 
Liam: I have been wondering why our university doesn't do more to promote sustainable transport. The parking lots are full every day, and barely anyone seems to use bikes or public transport. Shouldn't they be encouraging greener options? 
Ava: That's a good point. At my old college, they gave students discounts on bus passes and set up bike-sharing stations. It made leaving the car at home a lot more practical. I'm surprised our university hasn't implemented something similar yet. 
Noah: I think part of the problem is infrastructure. Even if the university promotes cycling, the surrounding roads don't have enough safe bike lanes. People worry about safety, and I can't really blame them for preferring cars. 
Liam: True. But maybe the university could start small, like adding more bike racks and secure storage areas on campus. That might encourage students who already own bikes to start riding more. 
Ava: And they could also launch a carpooling app for students. I've seen this work well at other universities. Students save money, reduce emissions, and meet others going the same way. 
Noah: Electric shuttle buses could be another option, especially for students living in nearby neighborhoods. They would cut down on traffic congestion and be a visible commitment to sustainability. 
Liam: That's a great idea. Also, raising awareness about existing public transport could help. Some students probably don't realize there are already bus routes passing close to campus. 
Ava: Agreed. And the university could partner with local transport providers for further discounts or promotional campaigns. It's about making sustainable choices the most convenient option. 
Noah: Right. At the end of the day, small initiatives add up. If the university leads with these efforts, students are much more likely to change their habits. 

022. Narrator: Three friends discuss future plans after graduation, balancing study, work, family pressure, and financial. 
Zane: I’ve been thinking about doing a Master’s degree after graduation. It feels like I need more qualifications to stand out. 
Maya: I used to think that too, but now I’m leaning toward working first. Real-world experience might give me better directionand maybe even help me figure out what I really want to study later. 
Elina: I’m kind of stuck. My family wants me to apply abroad, but I’m worried about the cost. It’s not just tuition it’s the living expenses, visas, everything. 
Zane: Yeah, studying abroad sounds great on paper, but it’s not easy financially. Did you check out scholarships? 
Elina: I did, but they’re super competitive. Plus, I don’t even know which country or program I’d choose. It feels like such a big commitment when I’m still unsure. 
Maya: That’s completely normal. Maybe take a gap year work, save, and explore your options with a clear head. I think we all feel some pressure to keep moving, but reflection is just as important. 
Zane: I agree. I’m applying to a couple of local universities just to keep my options open. Even if I get in, I might defer for a year to gain some experience or do an internship. 
Elina: That’s smart. And it takes the pressure off a bit you’re not closing doors, just buying time. 
Maya: And you’d be surprised how much you learn outside the classroom. Things like confidence, communication, and just figuring out what you’re passionate about. 
Zane: I guess we’ve all realized that there’s no “one right path,” right? 
Elina: Exactly. I think I’ll talk to my academic advisor and look into programs that allow flexibility maybe even online options for later. 
Maya: That sounds like a great plan. Do what feels right for you, not what others expect. 
Zane: Totally. Better to move with intention than just follow the crowd. 
Elina: Thanks, guys. I feel way less stressed after talking this out. 
Maya: Anytime! We’re all in this together. 

023. Narrator: A student, a professor, and an alumni relations officer discussed how alumni networks could contribute more actively to university growth and student support. 
Student: I think the university could do a lot more to engage alumni in supporting current students. There's so much untapped potential. Alumni could provide mentorship, internships, career advice, and even contribute financially through scholarships or program funding. It feels like we aren't fully leveraging those connections. 
Professor: I completely agree. Strong alumni networks can have a significant impact, not just on student success, but also on the university's global reputation. Graduates who are actively involved often help universities gain visibility in industries and professional circles. But maintaining those relationships after graduation requires consistent outreach and thoughtful engagement strategies. 
Alumni Relations Officer: Exactly. From an administrative perspective, we do maintain some alumni engagement through newsletters, social media updates, and occasional reunions. But sustaining long-term interest is challenging. Many graduates move to different cities or countries, change careers, or simply lose their connection to the campus over time. 
Student: Maybe we need more regular alumni-led events, both online and in person. Hearing from graduates about their career journeys, challenges, and achievements could be incredibly inspiring for students like me. It might also encourage alumni to stay connected by reminding them how they can make a difference. 
Professor: That's a great suggestion. Alumni could also contribute in other ways, such as supporting faculty research projects, participating in advisory boards, or offering internship placements for students within their organizations. But it's vital we create a culture where alumni feel valued for their time and expertise, not just approached for financial donations. 
Alumni Relations Officer: I think a virtual platform for alumni-student mentoring would be a good starting point. It would allow graduates, even those living abroad, to engage with students. Plus, it could include features like industry-specific networking groups or guest speaker opportunities. 
Student: That sounds promising. A pilot mentorship program could help test the concept. Pairing alumni with students from similar academic backgrounds or career interests would make those connections meaningful and relevant. 
Professor: Agreed. Strengthening alumni ties benefits everyone involved—the students gain valuable insights, the university strengthens its community, and alumni get the satisfaction of giving back. It's a win-win situation if implemented thoughtfully. 
Alumni Relations Officer: With careful planning, we could transform alumni engagement into a key pillar of university development. 
Student: I really hope this happens. It would make such a difference for students like me, knowing we have a network of supportive graduates to learn from. 
Professor: And from a faculty perspective, it would enrich our teaching and research too. Alumni bring fresh perspectives from the industry, and their involvement keeps us aligned with real-world trends. Their contribution could help bridge the gap between academia and professional practice more effectively.
