Just tell me the titles and the due date, and if you have your library card, I can use it, or I can return them at the desk with your name. If there are any fines, let me know and I'll keep the receipt. Focus on resting and getting better.

Sample response: I took that course last semester, and honestly it was much tougher than I expected. The workload is heavy, the readings are long, and the grading is quite strict. If you are already busy, I would not recommend it right now. Maybe take a lighter subject first or check the prerequisite skills. If you still want it, you should be ready to study every week and attend tutorials.

Could we please keep to our own desks and ask before using someone else's items? I will also label my stationery to avoid confusion. I hope that's okay. I just want to keep everything organized and fair for all of us.

Are there any areas where my evidence is weak or where I should clarify my points? If possible, could you suggest two or three specific improvements I should focus on before I submit? I'm happy to meet during your office hours if that is easier.

007. After choosing Subject A, you're thinking about changing it and consult your tutor about Subject B. What would you say?

Please tell me which option works best for you.
