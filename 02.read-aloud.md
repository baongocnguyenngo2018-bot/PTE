In the Kagoshima area of Kyushu, farmers used large, round, land-based tanks to produce 15,000 to 20,000 kilograms per hectare. Later, semi-intensive farms appeared on Japan's southern islands-Okinawa, for example.
4. Teamwork taps into one of the basic drivers of human behavior. The principle of social proof is so pervasive that we don't even recognize it," says Cialdini.

5. Researchers from 18 countries analyzed honey bee, other bee and non-bee insect visits to 480 fields of 17 different crop types on five continents. They found that total pollination services provided were the same for honey bees and non-bee insects 38 percent, with around a quarter of services twenty three percent, provided by other bees.
6. Methane is a waste product of the oil and gas industry that results in greenhouse gas pollution that is 25 times more powerful than CO2. Working with industry to cut these harmful emissions by almost half over the next ten years will dramatically reduce our greenhouse gas emissions.
7. The well-being, prosperity, and sustainability of human enterprise rely on the functioning of the Earth's natural systems and their complex physical, chemical, and biological processes. Water is a central theme in all terrestrial, oceanic, atmospheric, agricultural, and industrial systems.

16. 380 years after his death, William Shakespeare remains the central author of the English speaking world; he is the most quoted poet and the most regularly produced playwright and now among the most popular screenwriters as well. Why is that, and who "is" he? Why do so many people think his writing is so great? What meanings did his plays have in his own time, and how do we read, speak, or listen to his words now?
17. There were various explanations for volcano behaviour before the structure of the earth's mantle as a semisolid material was developed. For decades, awareness that compression and radioactive materials may be heat sources was discounted and volcanic action was often attributed to chemical reactions and a thin layer of molten rock near the surface. 
18. The whole purpose of making notes is to aid your learning. It is important to go back over them within a day of making them to make sure they make sense and make them legible for future revisions.

We've built levees to keep the water off the people, and we've raised the ones that were originally started in 1718.
21. The noise restrictions are based on measurements on animals in captivity exposed to noise levels that induce a temporary threshold shift (TTS) in hearing. The TTS onset threshold is the lowest noise exposure capable of inducing a small temporary reduction of hearing sensitivity, also known as auditory fatigue, with full recovery shortly after exposure.
22. Tissues are grouped together in the body to form organs. These include the brain, heart, lungs, kidneys, and liver. Each body organ has a specific shape and is made up of different types of tissue that work together. For example, the heart consists mainly of a specialized type of muscle tissue, which contracts rhythmically to provide the heart's pumping action. 
23. The audio, which includes more than 1,000 separate data files, was captured in the early 1970s by the late Hetty van de Rijt. She recorded the various screams, barks, and how calls made by a group of chimps, including 17 youngsters, living in the Gombe National Park in Tanzania.
24. The Royal Institution is an organisation that has been around for 209 years. Many of the people that have worked here have been scientists themselves, including Michael Faraday. He made the discoveries that may be generating a using electricity much easier, making it possible for us all to switch on lights, cook for dinner, play games consoles much more.
25. Australia has one of the world's most important mining industries. It is a major exporter of coal, iron ore, gold, and copper and is self sufficient in all minerals and bar petroleum. Since the first discoveries, the coal in 1798, mineral production has risen every year in the decade, and in 1992 it doubled.
26. In spite of the spectacularly high quality of life for the vast majority of the people who live in the European Union, its inhabitant seems obsessed by the region's relative decline in the world.

As the stratospheric temperatures reduced to minus 82.24 Celsius on 20th June, 2016 indicating the formation of stratospheric clouds which may lead to depletion of the ozone concentration in the stratosphere, leading scientists at Bharati station feared that Montreal Accord has not succeeded to control emission of ozone depleting gases In the atmosphere.
32. Foam filled furniture is very dangerous if it catches fire, and foam quickly produces a high temperature, thick smoke and poisonous gases including carbon monoxide. Therefore, set levels of fire resistance have been established for new and second hand upholstered furniture and other similar products.
33. All the works of art shown in this exhibition were purchased on a shoestring budget. The criteria that the curators had to follow were that works must be acquired cheaply, appeal to a broad range of tastes, and fit with unusual environments.
