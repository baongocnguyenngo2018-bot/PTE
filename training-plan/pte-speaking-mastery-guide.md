# **PTE Speaking Mastery Guide: Strategies & Tactics (2025 Format)**

This guide provides deep-dive strategies for all 8 speaking task types, organized by order of appearance in the exam.

## **1\. Personal Introduction**

*Status: Unscored (but crucial for warming up)*

The Strategy:  
Use this time to settle your nerves and check your microphone position. Do not overthink it.  
**The Template:**

"My name is \[Name\]. I am from \[Country\]. I am currently a student/working as a \[Job\]. I am taking this exam to pursue my higher studies/migration goals in \[Country\]. In my free time, I enjoy reading and traveling."

**Pro Tip:** Speak at a moderate volume. If you are too quiet here, you might be too quiet for the scored sections.

## **2\. Read Aloud (RA)**

*Skills: Reading & Speaking*

Core Strategy: "Fluency is King"  
The computer prioritizes oral fluency and pronunciation over 100% accuracy. If you stumble, never go back to correct yourself.  
**Tactics:**

* **The 3-Second Rule:** The microphone closes if you are silent for 3 seconds. Keep the rhythm going.  
* **Chunking:** Group words together naturally. Don't read w-o-r-d b-y w-o-r-d.  
  * *Bad:* The / impact / of / climate / change.  
  * *Good:* The impact / of climate change.  
* **Intonation:** Pitch up slightly at commas, pitch down at full stops to signal the end of a thought.

The "Difficult Word" Trick:  
If you see a word you can't pronounce (e.g., "bioaccumulation"), say something similar ("biology") or skip it entirely without breaking your flow. A smooth mistake scores higher than a stuttered correction.

## **3\. Repeat Sentence (RS)**

*Skills: Listening & Speaking*

Core Strategy: "The First Half Priority"  
Content is important, but fluency is critical. Most students fail because they try to remember 100% of the words and end up hesitating.  
**Tactics:**

* **The 50% Rule:** If a sentence is long, focus entirely on repeating the first 50-60% perfectly fluently.  
* **Mimicry:** You are an actor. If the speaker sounds angry, you sound angry. If they are fast, you are fast. Copy their stress patterns.  
* **No Notes:** Do not take notes. Close your eyes and visualize the scene.

Emergency Method:  
If you forget the sentence, say anything grammatically correct that you heard.

* *Heard:* "The library will be closed for renovation next Tuesday."  
* *Panic Response:* "The library is closed Tuesday." (Better than silence).

## **4\. Describe Image (DI)**

*Skills: Speaking*

Core Strategy: "The 25-Second Formula"  
You only have 40 seconds. Do not analyze. Just report data using a strict template.  
**Universal Template:**

1. **Intro:** "The image gives information about \[Title\]."  
2. **High/Low:** "From the picture, it is clear that \[Highest Value\] is the highest, whereas \[Lowest Value\] is the lowest."  
3. **Trend/Detail:** "It can also be seen that \[Category X\] is higher than \[Category Y\]."  
4. **Conclusion:** "In conclusion, the trend is increasing/decreasing."

**Handling Weird Images (Photos/Maps):**

* **Photos:** "The image shows a beautiful scene. On the left, I can see \[Color/Object\]. On the right, I can see \[Color/Object\]. The overall theme is nature/urban."  
* **Process Diagrams:** Use flow words: "First... Then... Next... Finally."

## **5\. Retell Lecture (RL)**

*Skills: Listening & Speaking*

Core Strategy: "Keywords over Sentences"  
Do not try to write full sentences. You will miss the next point.  
Note-Taking Technique:  
Write down 5–6 key phrases (Subject \+ Verb) vertically on your erasable notebook.

* *Example Notes:*  
  * Global warming  
  * Temp rising  
  * Sea level impact  
  * Future danger

**The Connector Template:**

"The speaker was discussing \[Topic/Main Idea\].  
He mentioned that \[Point 1 from notes\].  
He also highlighted that \[Point 2 from notes\].  
Furthermore, he discussed \[Point 3 from notes\].  
In conclusion, the lecture was very informative regarding \[Topic\]."

## **6\. Answer Short Question (ASQ)**

*Skills: Listening & Speaking*

Core Strategy: "Reflex Speed"  
These are general knowledge questions. The score weight is low, so don't stress.  
**Tactics:**

* **One or Two Words:** The answer is rarely a full sentence.  
  * *Q:* "Which organ pumps blood?" \-\> *A:* "Heart."  
* **Don't Know? Guess.** If you have no idea, repeat a key word from the question or guess "Zero" / "Gravity" / "Water" (common answers). Silence is the only wrong answer.

## **7\. Respond to Situation (New 2025\)**

*Skills: Speaking & Social Appropriateness*

Core Strategy: "The EAR Method"  
You are roleplaying. You need Empathy, Action, and Resolution.  
**Structure (40 Seconds):**

1. **Empathy (The "I" Statement):**  
   * "I completely understand your frustration regarding the delay..."  
   * "I am terribly sorry to hear that you received the wrong order..."  
2. **Action (The "Because" & "Solution"):**  
   * "The reason for this issue was a system error. However, I can offer you a full refund immediately."  
   * "This happened because we are understaffed. I will personally handle your request right now."  
3. **Resolution (Closing):**  
   * "I hope this solves the problem. Thank you for your patience."

Tone Check:  
Do not sound robotic. Use a "Customer Service Voice"—polite, firm, and clear.

## **8\. Summarize Group Discussion (New 2025\)**

*Skills: Listening & Speaking*

Core Strategy: "The Contrast Tracker"  
This task usually features 2-3 speakers debating or discussing a topic. You must identify who agrees and who disagrees.  
Note-Taking:  
Draw a T-Chart.

* **Left Column:** Speaker A (Idea/Agreement)  
* **Right Column:** Speaker B (Counter-idea/Disagreement)

**The Reporting Template:**

"The group discussed the topic of \[Main Topic\].  
Speaker A suggested that \[Idea 1\], arguing that it would be beneficial.  
On the other hand, Speaker B disagreed, pointing out that \[Counter-point\].  
Speaker C added that \[Point 3\].  
In conclusion, the group \[Agreed/Disagreed\] on the final decision."

**Key Vocabulary:**

* *Use:* "Suggested," "Argued," "Countered," "Emphasized," "Agreed."  
* *Avoid:* "Said," "Told," "Spoke."
