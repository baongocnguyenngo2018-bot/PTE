# **12-Day PTE Speaking Detailed Lesson Plan (2025 Format)**

Session Duration: 1 hour – 1 hour 15 minutes daily.  
Goal: Master the new PTE format (including 'Respond to Situation' and 'Group Discussion') through focused, high-intensity intervals.

## **Phase 1: Foundation & Mechanics (Days 1–4)**

*Focus: Mastering templates, pitch, and basic fluency.*

### **Day 1: Read Aloud (RA) & Repeat Sentence (RS)**

**Focus:** Intonation patterns and short-term memory.

* **0:00–0:10 (Warm-up):** Vocal warm-ups. Hum low to high pitch. Read a random paragraph of news at 1.2x speed to loosen tongue.  
* **0:10–0:35 (Read Aloud \- 25 mins):**  
  * **Drill:** Record 20 Read Aloud passages.  
  * **Technique Check:** Are you pausing at full stops? Is your pitch dropping at the end of sentences?  
  * **Review:** Listen to your recordings. Identify if you are "singing" (good intonation) or "robot" (monotone).  
* **0:35–1:05 (Repeat Sentence \- 30 mins):**  
  * **Drill:** 30 Sentences.  
  * **Constraint:** If a sentence is long, intentionally ignore the second half. Focus 100% on saying the first half fluently and mimicking the speaker's emotion.  
* **1:05–1:15 (Review):** Listen to your 3 worst RA recordings and re-record them perfectly.

### **Day 2: Describe Image (DI)**

**Focus:** Template automation and eliminating "thinking time."

* **0:00–0:10 (Template Drill):** Recite your chosen DI template 10 times as fast as possible. You must be able to say it without thinking.  
* **0:10–0:50 (Graph Marathon \- 40 mins):**  
  * **Set 1 (Bar Graphs):** Do 5 images. Focus on finding "Highest" and "Lowest" immediately.  
  * **Set 2 (Line Graphs):** Do 5 images. Focus on "Increasing/Decreasing" trends.  
  * **Set 3 (Pie Charts):** Do 5 images. Focus on comparing slices.  
* **0:50–1:10 (Review):**  
  * Did you pause for more than 2 seconds? If yes, use the filler phrase: *"The image also reveals information about..."*  
  * Re-do any image where you stumbled.

### **Day 3: Retell Lecture (RL) & Note-Taking**

**Focus:** Listening for keywords and using connectors.

* **0:00–0:15 (Listening Drill):** Listen to 3 TED Talk segments (60s each). Do not speak. Just practice writing down **5 keywords** per segment.  
* **0:15–0:55 (Retell Lecture \- 40 mins):**  
  * **Drill:** Complete 10 Retell Lectures using your notes.  
  * **Template Application:** Ensure every lecture follows the structure: *"The speaker discussed \[Topic\]... He mentioned \[Key 1\]... He also highlighted \[Key 2\]... In conclusion..."*  
* **0:55–1:10 (Review):** Check your recordings. Did you finish between 30s and 40s? If you finished too early (\<25s), you need one more sentence in your template.

### **Day 4: New 2025 Tasks (Situation & Group Discussion)**

**Focus:** Tone flexibility and multi-speaker tracking.

* **0:00–0:30 (Respond to Situation \- 30 mins):**  
  * **Scenario Drill:** Practice 10 scenarios (e.g., explaining a delay, refusing a request).  
  * **Tone Check:** Record yourself. Do you sound rude? Do you sound too soft? Aim for **Professional Empathy**.  
  * **Structure:** Acknowledge (10s) \-\> Explain/Solve (20s) \-\> Close (5s).  
* **0:30–1:00 (Summarize Group Discussion \- 30 mins):**  
  * **Listening:** Listen to 3 multi-speaker audio clips.  
  * **Note-Taking:** Create a T-Chart. Left side: Speaker A (Agrees). Right side: Speaker B (Disagrees).  
  * **Speaking:** Summarize for 60–90 seconds using reporting verbs (*"suggested," "argued," "countered"*).  
* **1:00–1:15 (Self-Correction):** Re-listen. Did you confuse who said what? Correctness matters here more than in Retell Lecture.

## **Phase 2: Intensity & Speed (Days 5–9)**

*Focus: Handling pressure and switching between tasks.*

### **Day 5: High-Speed Read Aloud**

**Focus:** Oral fluency and reading speed.

* **0:00–0:10:** Warm-up.  
* **0:10–0:50 (Speed Reading):**  
  * Read 15 passages. Try to read them slightly faster than comfortable.  
  * **The Stumble Rule:** If you make a mistake, **do not go back**. Force yourself to continue to the next word immediately.  
* **0:50–1:15 (Review):** Analyze the waveforms of your recording. Are there long flat lines (silence)? Eliminate them.

### **Day 6: Describe Image Randomization**

**Focus:** Dealing with difficult/weird images (Maps, Photos, Diagrams).

* **0:00–0:15:** Template warm-up.  
* **0:15–1:00 (Random Images):**  
  * Do 15 non-standard images (Maps, Process Diagrams, Photographs).  
  * **Strategy:** If you don't understand the image, read the title and describe colors/shapes. *Never stop speaking.*  
* **1:00–1:15 (Review):** Pick the hardest image and try to describe it again smoothly.

### **Day 7: Repeat Sentence Visualization**

**Focus:** Improving retention without notes.

* **0:00–1:00 (The "Blind" Hour):**  
  * Do 40 Repeat Sentences.  
  * **Technique:** Close your eyes. Visualize the sentence happening. Do not write anything down.  
  * **Score Yourself:** 3/3 for fluency, even if you missed a word. 0/3 if you hesitated.  
* **1:00–1:15:** Rest vocal cords. Review high-frequency vocabulary for RS.

### **Day 8: Integrated Switching (RL \+ Group Disc)**

**Focus:** Brain switching between Monologue (RL) and Dialogue (Group) tasks.

* **0:00–1:00 (Alternating Drill):**  
  * Task 1: Retell Lecture (Monologue).  
  * Task 2: Summarize Group Discussion (Dialogue).  
  * Task 3: Retell Lecture.  
  * Task 4: Summarize Group Discussion.  
  * *Repeat pattern.*  
* **Why?** This prevents your brain from getting "stuck" in one template. You must actively switch your reporting verbs (*"The speaker said"* vs *"The group discussed"*).  
* **1:00–1:15:** Review notes. Were your notes clear enough to read back instantly?

### **Day 9: Short Answer & Situation Rapid Fire**

**Focus:** Reflexes and quick thinking.

* **0:00–0:30 (Answer Short Question):**  
  * Rapid fire 50 questions using a PTE question bank/app.  
  * Don't overthink. If you don't know, say "Unknown" or guess immediately. Silence is the enemy.  
* **0:30–1:00 (Respond to Situation):**  
  * 10 difficult scenarios (e.g., academic disputes, lost items).  
  * Focus on the **First Sentence**. The moment the prompt ends, you must start speaking within 1 second.  
* **1:00–1:15:** Review.

## **Phase 3: Simulation & Polish (Days 10–12)**

*Focus: Exam conditions and confidence.*

### **Day 10: The "Half-Mock"**

**Focus:** Endurance and concentration.

* **0:00–1:00 (Simulated Test):**  
  * Set up a playlist to mimic the exam sequence:  
    * 1 Personal Intro  
    * 5 Read Alouds  
    * 8 Repeat Sentences  
    * 3 Describe Images  
    * 1 Retell Lecture  
    * 1 Respond to Situation  
  * **Condition:** Play "Cafe Noise" on YouTube in the background at 30% volume.  
* **1:00–1:15:** Breathe. Do not review today. Just survive the simulation.

### **Day 11: Weakness Targeting**

**Focus:** Fixing the leaking bucket.

* **0:00–0:15:** Listen to Day 10's mock recording. Identify the **one** section where you lost the most fluency.  
* **0:15–1:15 (Targeted Practice):**  
  * Spend the entire hour on that specific section.  
  * *Example:* If Describe Image was shaky, do 20 images. If Read Aloud was flat, do 15 with exaggerated intonation.

### **Day 12: The "Confidence" Day**

**Focus:** Light practice and mindset.

* **0:00–0:30 (Light Drill):**  
  * 5 Read Alouds (Easy ones).  
  * 5 Describe Images (Easy ones).  
  * Confirm your microphone position and breathing.  
* **0:30–1:00 (Template Final Check):**  
  * Write down your templates from memory one last time. Ensure every word is correct.  
* **Goal:** Finish feeling successful. Do not attempt hard questions that might lower your confidence before the exam.
