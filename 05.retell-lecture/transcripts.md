001. Our civilization, which subsumes most of its predecessors, is a great ship steaming at speed into the future. It travels faster, further, and more laden than any before. We may not be able to foresee every reef and hazard, but by reading her compass bearing and headway, by understanding her design, her safety record, and the abilities of her crew, we can. I think, plot a wise course between the narrows and bergs looming ahead. And I believe we must do this without delay. because there are too many shipwrecks behind us. The vessel we are now aboard is not merely the biggest of all time; it is also the only one left. The future of everything we have accomplished since our intelligence evolved will depend on the wisdom of our actions over the next few years. Like all creatures, humans have made their way in the world so far by trial and error, unlike other creatures. we have a presence so colossal that error is a luxury we can no longer afford. The world has grown too small to forgive us any big mistakes. 
002. Deliberate practice takes time and people also need to find and solve problems and mistakes during it. To be a high performing solo musician for the violin you also have to spend several dozen hundreds of hours in solitary practice. When it comes to other things, for example, studying geometry, it is still the case. During practice you should identify your weakness, focus on it, and carry out further deliberate practice to demonstrate how important deliberate practice is. Even for talents, they generally need spend ten years to achieve the high international level of recognition. So there is no need for average people to be ashamed to practice. 
003. Morton Prince was an American physician and psychologist, his book 'Dissociation of a Personality' was the best-seller at that time. It tells a story of Miss Christine Beauchamp, who was suffering from MPD (Multiple Personality Disorder). Miss Christine Beauchamp has several types of personalities, namely B1, B2 and B3. There was hidden memory in these three personalities, with hallucination among them. Miss Beauchamp was B2. B2 knows about B1, B3 knows both B1 and B2, but B1 knows nothing about B2 or B3. The strongest personality accounts for most of the time and it will take over the others and become the main personality at the end. This case and theory gives great help to crime investigation. 
004. The biotech engineering has undergone three phases. In the first phase, people designed and made some simple machines, which aimed to help people understand ourselves. And first group of people that realized we could learn from ourselves were engineers. And then, based on the studies, people began to make complicated devices, in order to cure wounds, like the practice of suture, and to study physiology. This is the second phase. Later, since we went into the third phase, more complicated machines have been developed, like ECG (electrocardiography), able to have an insight of your internal body without intruding it, which can show the human brain's functions. X-ray is a good example. In an X-ray picture, you can see the bright area is the heart with some vessels around, and the dark area is the lungs. These devices benefit humans greatly in solving health problems, such as diseases. 
005. Happiness comes from frequency and quality of social relation. The higher the frequency is, the more happiness relations with friends and family and others produce. It is not sure why social relation is correlated with happiness. But there’s evidence that when people feel more satisfied with their social relations, they will feel happier, in turn, when people feel happier, they will get more satisfied with social relations. Happy people tend to be social more with friends and have more interaction between family. Some people wonder if their social activities make them happier or their happy personalities drive them to be social more with their friends and families. 
006. Female: Which one are you going to write more in your book, science or scientists? Male: I do want very much to write something about science, actually. So I prefer to scientists. Female: All right. What's interesting in scientists then? Male: Science is just like complex furniture, which is all about evidence. But scientists can tell stories, do researches and propose questions to find what is true. They are like a focal point. They are always in interesting situations. Female: Whether science or scientists your book mainly about, it seems to be rather hard for general readers to understand, doesn't it? Male: I don't think so, really. In fact the book I write is a science fiction, which is related with science but is not strictly scientific. So you don't have to have a PhD degree in physics or other disciplines to understand a science fiction. And loving science is very different from being a scientist, which means fiction writing is not the same as writing scientific journals. When scientists fail, they will question the situation about why they have failed. But as a fiction writer, I don't have to. In my book, you can always see stories about 'happy family'. 
007. The British press came into existence in the 18th century, a time of great change and progress. Since then, it has played a pivotal role in shaping public opinion and discourse. Freedom of speech, a cornerstone of democratic societies, has been encouraged by British policy from the very beginning. This freedom allowed people to discuss anything and everything in public places, such as coffee houses or on the streets. These public spaces became hubs of intellectual exchange, where newspapers were read and issues of the day were debated. Topics ranged from politics and government policies to military matters, reflecting the diverse interests of the public. This open dialogue is a testament to the freedom enjoyed by the public. But the story doesn't end there. The British press has evolved with time, embracing new technologies and adapting to changing societal norms. Today, it continues to inform, educate, and provoke thought, reaching millions of readers through print and digital platforms. Moreover, the British press plays a crucial role in holding power to account. It scrutinizes government actions, champions the rights of the marginalized, and shines a light on issues that matter. In conclusion, the British press, with its rich history and commitment to freedom of speech, is more than just a news source. It's a symbol of public freedom, a watchdog of democracy, and an integral part of British society.Thank you for listening.
008. Let's unfold the realm of 'Literature' and its profound impact on society. Literature is not just an escape; it's a mirror that reflects our realities, a lens that sharpens our worldview. Literature fosters empathy. When we dive into the narratives of characters from diverse backgrounds, we live a multitude of lives. This vicarious experience enriches our understanding of others, bridging gaps across cultures and experiences. Furthermore, literature is a catalyst for social change. It has the power to challenge norms, to question policies, and to push boundaries. The works of authors like Harriet Beecher Stowe and George Orwell have spurred movements and reformed societies. As we engage with literature, let us recognize its role in shaping the contours of society. In the pages of books, we find the seeds of the future, sown with words that can move nations. 
009. For too long, discussions about climate change have been about sacrifice. I am here to tell you that climate solutions actually make a better city and a better quality of life for everyone. This is only the first of five lessons we have learned on our journey to become an emission-free city. And I think these lessons can be applied almost anywhere. So I like to share them. So lesson number one, confronting climate change is about creating better cities and better quality of life for everyone, including those kids in the kindergarten, that don’t have to share their days with noisy excavators. The second lesson is about being ambitious. In 2015, the city council set a target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 95 percent by 2030 without purchasing any carbon offsets. So aiming for real reductions. Commitment to this goal changed our mindset. If we were going to reach this target, every department had to get active, figure out measures and finding out how to implement them. So second lesson, be ambitious. A target measured in years, not decades, provides no excuse for inaction. 
010. In this lesson, we discuss the similarities and differences between the eukaryotic cells of your body and prokaryotic cells such as bacteria. Eukaryotes organize different functions within specialized membrane-bound compartments called organelles These structures do not exist in prokaryotes. Your body's composed of trillions of cells - lots of different types of cells that make up different organs and other parts of your body. Your body is also where 10 times that number of bacteria call 'home sweet home.' But don't be afraid - these bacteria do more good than harm to you. And besides, just in case you wanted to strike up a conversation with your tenants, you and your bacteria do have a few things in common. All cells share some common characteristics that make them living things. All organisms are composed of cells, the basic fundamental unit of life. They contain DNA as a heritable genetic material, and they can reproduce. They transcribe DNA into RNA and translate RNA into proteins on ribosomes. They can also regulate transport across a cell membrane and require chemical energy for some cellular processes. Organelles are the biggest difference between bacteria and cells that make up the human body Organelles
011. I think with our linguistic training we also get all this invisible training to be authorities, to be the people who know. It is part of that process that you come out as a world authority on your chosen subject. But when we move into working with communities, we have to recognize that the communities have to be the authority in their language. Actually, a woman in the class I'm teaching at Sydney at the moment, a career woman, expressed this very nicely, although she was talking about something else, she was distinguishing expertise from authority. And certainly linguists, because of the training we do, have expertise in certain very narrow areas of language, but we don't have the authority over what to do with that knowledge or what to do with other knowledge that the community produces. I guess for me the bottom line is languages are lost because of the dominance of one person over another. That's not rocket science, it's not hard to work that out. But then what that means is if in working with language revival we continue to hold the authority, we actually haven't done anything towards undoing how languages are lost in the first place, so in a sense, the languages are still lost if the authority is still lost.
012. The impact on young Australians who are interested in buying a home of their own has been very significant. Australia's housing affordability now shapes the typical housing cycle or housing career as some people call it. Most Australians in the normal course of events are people who move through the housing cycle in a way that matches the stages of life that they're at. So, they move out of the family home in their late teens or early 20s as they gain their independence from their families, then they rent to save for a home they can afford as either a group or maybe a couple. And maybe they can upgrade it when they have a family in their middle age, they are more than likely to have paid off their mortgage. And that means they have housing security in their old age. That's no longer the typical housing cycle for Australians, young people generally live at home for much longer than they once did. They generally rent for longer and they're more likely to be saddled with a mortgage not just into their middle age but more often than not into their retirement as well. In fact, in 2006, 65,000 retiree households were still paying off the mortgage. Affordable rent is also an elusive right around Australia. We have very low rental vacancies, we see high turnover as landlords want to maximize their profits in a tight market, and we see less long-term or lifelong rental, as we see in other countries and other economies.
013. It's time for this young loggerhead turtle to go to work. We can tether turtles in these little clock harnesses put them into this tank and they'll swim in place. University of North Carolina biologist Canelo men study see turtles that are programmed from birth for an extraordinary journey. The mother turtles bury the eggs on the beach and then returned to the sea and the eggs hatch about 50 to 60 days later. The support for National Science Foundation Lomond is learning how these reptiles use the earth's magnetic field to navigate 5 to 10-year journey around the Atlantic Ocean. The turtles seem to inherit a set of responses that tell them what to do when they encounter specific magnetic fields at particular locations. This animal magnetism can be a lifesaver one field off Portugal triggers the turtles to turn south if they don't they'll likely die swept into frigid North Atlantic waters in one lab test turtles responded to magnetic field similar to what they would encounter off the coast of Florida the great majority of them turned southeast. Now, this is an exciting finding because south-easterly orientation in this part of the world would presumably take turtles further into the Gulf Stream so the turtles actually have what might be considered a crude Global Positioning System that is based on the earth's magnetic field. And check out this experiment these turtle moves may look odd. The turtles will actually act out there swimming behavior in air. But this wave simulator recreates the first environmental cue hatchling turtles respond to. And to swimming into waves is a highly reliable trick the turtles use to guide themselves up short.
014. Loggerhead turtles are the most abundant of all the marine turtle species in U.S. waters. But persistent population declines due to pollution, shrimp trawling, and development in their nesting areas, among other factors, have kept this wide-ranging sea-goer on the threatened species list since 1978. Their enormous range encompasses all but the most frigid waters of the world's oceans. They seem to prefer coastal habitats, but often frequent inland water bodies and will travel hundreds of miles out to sea. The largest of all hard-shelled turtles leatherbacks are bigger but have soft shells loggerheads have massive heads, strong jaws, and a reddish-brown shell, or carapace. Adult males reach about three feet in shell length and weigh about 250 pounds, but large specimens of more than 1,000 pounds have been found. They are primarily carnivores, munching jellyfish, conchs, crabs, and even fish, but will eat seaweed and sargassum occasionally. Mature females will often return, sometimes over thousands of miles, to the beach where they hatched to lay their eggs. Worldwide population numbers are unknown, but scientists studying nesting populations are seeing marked decreases despite endangered species protections.
015. Can we never get to absolute zero? What a wonderful question. I wish I had a wonderful answer to go with it. Here is the problem, there is actually a law of physics called the third law of thermodynamics, that says you cannot get to the absolute zero, but we don't really know it's true, but we are pretty sure it is for the following reason: every time you think of some way of cooling something down a little bit, it means you try to get energy out of that thing and make the temperature lower. Well if you can get energy out, usually there is a way that the energy can go in as well. And that always means there is a competition between taking the energy out and putting the energy in. Now you can try to make it, so you are favoring getting energy out, but you can't completely stop the energy from going in and that means you might be able to get colder and colder, but you won't be able to get all the way to absolute zero. Could we go back to my PowerPoint, because I think that one of these slides will illustrate that point a little bit better? Yes, here, remember the logarithmic thermometer? There is no zero on this logarithmic thermometer, just keeps going down, you make it a fact of 10 colder, you're not a zero. You make it a fact of 10 colder, you're still not a zero. You make it a fact of 10 colder, you're still not a zero. So, you start a million of a degree, now you are 10 millions of a degree, now you are 100 millions of a degree. Now you are billions of degrees. You never get to zero that way. You get closer and closer, but you never get to zero. So that's why we cannot get to absolute zero.
016. On this illustration often used is the one that the monkeys and the typewriters. Ok, we have a monkey sitting at a typewriter and the claim here is basically if you leave chance in time long enough you will get a life, don't worry about it, yes, its's strange, yes, it's wonderful, but leave enough matter 600 million years on earth and you will have life. So, the monkey sifting at the typewriter the chances are eventually he produces the complete works of Shakespeare so what's the problem. But he doesn't manage to do it in 600 million years. So, what I decided to do is to run the numbers. I, instead of saying typing the complete work of Shakespeare, I just run the numbers for how long would it take a monkey typing one key striker a second. To type to be or not to be that is the question'. Right? On average how long is it gonna take my monkey friend one keystroke a second? I don't know how you think it would be. Maybe you could have a guess. Would it be less or more than 600 million years, which is the period life on earth isn't supposed to have emerged within and when I run the numbers" to be or not to be is the question' takes 12.6 trillion trillion trillion trillion years to type just that phrase and a DNA string has got as much as information the encyclopedia Britannica? Are we saying that something of that complexity emerges by chance undirected within 600 million years? Again, it's mathematically possible but it's so incredibly unlikely that it would have that it tilts me in favor of the Christian story in which God created life, simply a question of saying let that be and there was. 
017. The way a mother rat takes care of its pups is by licking and grooming, nipple switching an arch back nursing. So the rats that do a lot of licking and grooming and their last rats that rule very little. But most rats are in between. So that resembles a human behaviour as well, right you have mothers that are highly mothering and mothers that couldn't care less and most mothers are somewhere in between. So if you look at these rats. So all you do you observe them and put them in separate cages. So you put the high lickers in one cage not the mothers, but the offspring and the low lickers in another cage and then you let them grow and they're adults now, their mothers are long buried and you look in the brain and you see that those who had high licking mothers express a lot of glucocorticoid receptor, gene and though so our lawmakers express to know that reflects a number of factors and that results in a different stress response, but this is not the only difference. We found, later on, there are hundreds of genes that are differently expressed. So if you get in a mutation, you know polymorphism once in a million. Here, just the motherly launching just hundreds of genes in one shot and it changes them in a very stable way that you can look at the old rat and you can say whether it was licked or not. But you can also save by behaviour. So if you walk to the cages to the room the rats that were poorly lit are highly anxious, hard to handle, aggressive and the rats that were very well handled as off as little pups. They are much more relaxed much easier to handle. So you know, like every technician in the lab knows to look at the adult rat how it was licked when it was a little tough any question of course. mechanism. how does this work? 
018. This busy little town is named after St. David's first cousin. It's also a Welsh language stronghold. According to the 2001 census results, seventy percent of the town's population could speak Welsh but even here the language may not be completely safe. The Welsh language board expects last year's census results to show a fall in the number of Welsh speakers living in its northern and western heartlands. One of the main reasons for that the board says is migration. Many Welsh speakers are choosing to leave the country. At the same time, only a small percentage of those moving in can speak the language or choose to learn it. Historically, over the past 1788 Wales people have continually left in order to find better standard of pay maybe in quality of employment and the things have change was probably is that them there is a larger amount of English people now who have found Wales of the last 20-25 years particularly this corner of Wales and regarded is a desirable place to come and live and as opposed to many areas in England and cheaper as well.
019. But there was no modern lit Wilson came then from a different world and he became the focal point of a broad mainstream American culture that thought that modern literature and wanted modern literature to be able to be read and appreciated by ordinary people, they were not modernists in an abstract sense and certainly some of them like TS Eliot and Faulkner were too difficult for some of their writings to be read by ordinary people, but this was a world before the division between the brows or between a lead or whatever had established itself as part of our consciousness. Wilson was a major player in the successful effort of his generation to establish at the heart of American life and innovative literature that would equal the great cultures of Europe. And he knew that the great cultures of Europe were there he was not a product of a narrow American Studies kind of training at all. He joined a high artistic standard with an openness to all experience and a belief that literature was as much a part of life for everyone as a conversation. He thought that Proust and Joyce and Yeats and Eliot could and should be read by ordinary Americans and helped that to happen. Wilson was a very various man over a period of almost 50 years. He was a dedicated literary journalist, an investigative reporter, a brilliant memoirist, and a dedicated journal keeper.
020. As Joanne pointed out only one country tiny little Bhutan wedged between China and India has adopted the gross national happiness as the central index of government policy and actually has had a good deal of success in education and in health and in economic growth and in environmental preservation and they have rather sophisticated way of measuring the effects of different policies on people's happiness but they're the only country to go that far but you're now beginning to get other countries interested enough to do kind of white paper policy analyses about whether happiness research what effects would it have we used it more for public policy you're beginning to get to countries like Australia, France, Great Britain that are considering pushing regular statistics on happiness so it's beginning to become a subject of greater interest for policymakers and legislators and different advanced countries. 
021. These guidelines are designed to assist clients to access the free public computers and the internet in a responsible and informed way. Although all care is taken to ensure a virus free computer for public use. You’ve to use the service desk after entering the library and you can have these services at the service desk. There are computers on each floor. You can use computers to access the internet, check emails & library catalogs. Follow the arm signs to find printers. Follow the instructions to use the printer. Remember to bring your student cards. You can charge the card to use printers. 
022. Many parents communicate and educate their children with two languages, probably because they both know more than one language, or they come from different countries. Most of these parents think this can benefit their children’s language learning. But actually kids will get confused when their parents use different languages from each other to describe the same object. If one parent sticks to one language, and the other one sticks to another language, their children will not be confused any more. 
023. We normally see blogging as a two-way interaction, in which the blogger/author creates the content and the readers interact or challenge the author. But the case will be much difficult when it comes to government, such as the White House. Because people will become coarser and ride online, especially in the comment area. Hence the government blog may go wild and chaotic. So the government will have to administrate the comment. Once the government starts administrating the comment, citizens may find the government manipulating what should be said and what should be shown, which contradicts the original intention. 
024. Determinant, human behavior is affected by internal and external factors. At the end of lecture, the speaker mentioned that psychologists are interested in explaining human behavior. Determinant is influenced by two factors, the personal factors which are internal and the environmental factors which are external. The personal factors include people's belief on certain things and their individual thinking about it, while the environmental factors include temperature, air pressure and the others' thinking about them. In conclusion, one's determinants are affected by both himself and the environment. Sample answer: This lecture is about determinants of human behavior. It is affected by both internal and external factors. At the end of lecture, the speaker mentioned that psychologists are interested in explaining human behavior. Generally, the personal factors are considered to be internal and environmental factors are external. Personal factors include people's belief on certain things and their individual thinking about it, while the environmental factors include temperature, air pressure and the others' thinking about them. In conclusion, human behavior is affected by both himself and the environment. 
025. I'm just going to take on where Stafford left off and the hormone I want to talk to you about is called melatonin and is synthesized in the pineal gland which is very small it's the size of a pea in your brain Jaykar called the seat of the soul and it is where melatonin is made. So it's working and it has a rhythm as well and in a sense, it's the opposite of cortisol it peaks at night we call it the darkness hormone in every species that we studied melatonin occurs at night and it's a hormone that prepares you for the things that your species does at nights so of course in humans we sleep but animals like rodents they're awake so it's a hormone that is related to darkness behavior. 
026. It is wrong, however, to exaggerate the similarity between language and other cognitive skills, because language stands apart in several ways. For one thing, the use of language is universal-all normally developing children learn to speak at least one language, and many learn more than one. By contrast, not everyone becomes proficient at complex mathematical reasoning, few people learn to paint well, and many people cannot carry a tune. Because everyone is capable of learning to speak and understand language, it may seem to be simple. But just the opposite is true-language is one of the most complexes of all human cognitive abilities. 
027. It is almost impossible these days not to include photography in a course on the history of arts,agent who suggests that technology and art didn't go well together, photography with its realism its accurate representation of the thing in front of you, initially deprived many artists of their subject matter forcing them to look in new ways no bad thing, true mass produced images saved the Monalisa obviously can't provide the same experience as seeing the real painting on the other hand there are photographs which to my mind a formal suit provoking and have great emotional impact than a painting of the same subject ever could, some people say that the traditional idea of an artist with a trained hand and eye is old fashioned, we no longer believe that an artist needs specialist knowledge but rather that he or she can simply point the camera at the scene and record it, however on the one hand that ignores the creative skill involved in producing photograph on the other hand it also ignores the fact that even in the past painters used in various technological aids, foe example the dutch painter Xenia used a camera obscure to help him create his images, we will go into that later but for now i want to look the documentary and cultural value of photography. 
028. Alexis de Tocqueville, as we have noted, appears to have had some appeal to both ends of the political spectrum - left and right or rather, both have found him to be useful for their purposes in certain circumstances. His rational acceptance of the new forces of democracy brought about by the American and French revolutions made him an icon of left-wing liberals. However, during the Cold War - that is, from the end of World War II until the collapse of communism he was adopted by some leading thinkers on the right. So, there are two sides to his political philosophy, and the man himself. that we need to look at. Now, I would suggest that de Tocqueville's biography is important here. You must always bear in mind when reading him that he was an aristocrat and one whose family had suffered in the French Revolution. He wasn't your typical aristocrat because his politics differed from others of his family and social rank. He abandoned the Catholic church and married beneath his class. Yet he never quite threw off the prejudices of that class. However, and what is important, he did recognize and believe that the tendency of history, which in those days could be traced back to the Middle Ages, was towards the leveling of social ranks, and more equal and democratic conditions. The French Revolution had in the end brought Napoleon, whom he hated, but democracy would inevitably come to France. His trip to America was to see democracy in practice. make note of its shortcomings and errors, and then find safeguards against them. 
029. Now, you might think it strange that in a lecture on biology, I will be talking a lot about mathematics... umm ... If I may digress a bit ... When I was a student, mathematics, the language of dear abstraction, had nothing to do with life sciences like biology, the sphere of messy organic forms, cutting up frogs in the lab, and so on... um ... In fact, I started doing biology precisely to avoid maths and physics. So, I've had a lot of catching up to do. We are all aware of how the sciences have come to inter-relate more and more, and not only will mathematics impinge more and more on biology but also, I am told, in the 21" century, the driving force behind mathematics will be biology. This is partly because mathematicians are always on the lookout for more areas to conquer. But a far greater reason is that the subject has been boiled down to physics and chemistry - obvious attractions for mathematicians. A number of mathematical fields can be applied to biology. For example, knot theory is used in the analysis of the tangled strands of DNA, and abstract geometry in four or more dimensions is used to tell us about viruses. Again, neuroscience appears to be maths friendly and equations can also explain why hallucinogenic drugs cause the users to see spirals. So, if mathematicians are taking such a keen interest in biology, the least we can do as biologists is return the compliment. 
030. Most of what the general public knows about daily life in ancient Rome comes from art, architecture, and literature, which tell us more about the elites, especially ... umm ... the goings-on of the emperors... but how much do we know of the lives of ordinary Romans? Did they have a voice, apart, that is, from what we can gather from graffiti? The usual picture is one of time spent at festivals, baths, and, typically, the games. However, for many Romans, terrible living conditions, poverty, debt and the chance of being sold into slavery at any moment - that is, if they weren't slaves already - left no time or energy for such forms of entertainment, or for any interest in politics, for that matter. Indeed, after the death of Augustus, executive power was taken from the elected assemblies of the Roman people. Now it was the emperor's job to look after the people, and his generosity often depended on the mood and behavior of the people - on how often and how violently they protested and rioted. One example would be clauctius ensuring a steady grain supply, even in winter, after rioters pelted him with stale crusts of bread. There is an anecdote about, umm, Hadrian. While touring the provinces, an old lady approached him with a complaint; he made excuses and tried to getaway. She said that if he wouldn't give her a hearing, he shouldn't be emperor. She got her hearing. 
031. Climate change means springtime's arriving earlier across North America. But the season's onset isn't changing at the same rate across the nation. "Spring is not advancing as quickly in southern regions as it is in northern regions." Eric Waller, a bio geographer at the U.S. Geological Survey. He and his team analyzed more than a hundred years of data on when the first leaves and flowers emerge across North America. And they found that although spring has sprung earlier nearly everywhere, in certain wildlife refuges, the season hits extremely early. And that mismatch could be a problem for migratory birds, who might leave their temperate overwintering grounds down south at the usual time, only to find out they've arrived up north too late. "Their food resources might be withering and they might not have as much food available to them. And that could affect their reproduction, their breeding." The analysis is in the journal PLOS ONE. The upshot: it may be more difficult than we thought to predict the effects of climate change on migratory birds. But the data might help land managers decide which plots of land to acquire, to augment existing reserves and in doing so, ensure that even later birds still get the worm. 
032. I was right in Shasta and I'm a politician and experimental phonologists, and my research mainly concentrates on how human speech sounds are produced, and the relationship between that physical production and the vocal tract and the acoustics of the speech sound itself. So, in order to study things like position of the tongue, the lips, the soft palate, the larynx, the jaw, it's important to be able to use a number of different technologies in tandem with acoustic recording. So, technology that I use includes magnetic resonance imaging, electromagnetic articulography, electropalatography, and speech aerodynamics to better create models and maps between the position and movement of the articulators in the vocal tract and the acoustics of speech. This work has important implications for speech pathology, speech recognition, and speech synthesis. 
033. When this dog approaches some food, another dog's playful snarls are played back the dog seems curious, but the sound doesn't stop it from taking the bone. Here a dog hears the growls of a dog being approached by a stranger, but these don't deter it from grabbing the bone either. In another scenario, the sound of a dog protecting its food is played back. This time the dog backs off. These experiments suggest the dogs can distinguish between different types of growls. 
034. This is one picture that you probably you all know what it is when you see it. It's a familiar-looking image. It's something that probably we all have some personal experience with, right? This is a chest x-ray that would be taken in your doctor's office, for example or a radiologist's office. And it is a good example of Biomedical Engineering and that it takes a physical principle, that is how do x-rays interact with the tissues of your body, and it uses that physics, that physical principle to develop a picture of what's inside your body, so to look inside and see things that you couldn't see without this device. And you'll recognize some parts of the image, you can see the ribcage here, the bones you can see the heart is the large bright object down here. If you have good eyesight from the distance, you can see the vessels leading out of the heart and into the lungs, and the lungs are darker spaces within the ribcage. 
035. For better or worse, we live in a world profoundly affected by Sigmund Freud. If I had to ask you to name a famous psychologist, the answer of most of you would be Freud. He was the most famous psychologist ever and he had a profound influence on the 20th and 21st century. Some biographical information: he was born in the 1850s. He spent most of his life in Vienna, Austria, but he died in London and he escaped to London soon after retreating there at the beginning of World War Two as the Nazis began to occupy where he lived. He was one of the most famous scholars ever but he was not known for any single discovery. Instead, he was known for the development of an encompassing theory of mind, one that he developed over the span of many decades. 
036. When you think of a leader, you may think of an individual who is above all bold. But a new study of fish called sticklebacks shows that shy individuals actually prefer to follow fish that are similarly timid. Researchers had trios of sticklebacks with known personalities play follow the leader. The fish were placed in a tank that had some plastic plants at one end and some food hidden at the other. In some of the groups, a bold fish and a shy fish acted as leaders, while another shy fish followed. And in other groups, it was a bold fish that did the following. The researchers recorded whether the follower sallied forth more frequently with the fish that was behaviorally similar or the one that was different. What they found is that shy fish were more likely to emerge from undercover when an equally wary fellow was already out there. Bold follower fish did not seem to care which leader they followed. Of course, no matter which fish a stickleback chose to stick with, the bold fish did lead more expeditions over the course of the experiment than their more retiring friends. That’s because the bold fish initiated more trips, regardless of who might be tailing them. The findings are in the journal Biology Letters. The researchers write that “when offered a choice of leaders, sticklebacks prefer to follow individuals whose personality matches their own, but bolder individuals may, nevertheless, be able to impose their leadership, even among shy followers, simply through greater effort.” We may soon see if such tendencies also hold true in humans when Americans decide who they’ll follow in November. Unless, of course, something fishy happens. 
037. So what do we mean by well-being? Health, happiness, a sense of achievement and contentment, a state of mind and body where people can thrive. Well-being is not something that is purely limited to people who are facing extraordinary challenges in their lifestyle, health, or personal circumstances. Everybody here has a level of well-being. Music so often forms an intuitive part of our well-being management: music to pick us up, music to calm us down, music to heal our sorrows. Our aim through research is to move from this level of intuitive application of music through to informed use in our communities to take the next step in the understanding of the power of music in human life. Music already works for us on so many levels, whether it's soothing and teaching our infants, bringing people and communities together, adding spirit to our work and personal endeavors, but there is no reason to stop here. 
038. This is a kind of object that you're probably all familiar with when you had the term robot, but I'm gonna show you the very, very first robots. These were the very first robots. They were characters in a play in the 1920s called Rossum's Universal Robots, and they…, the play was written by Czech writer called Karel Capek. And basically, these robots, you know, people tend to think of robots as kind of cute cuddly toys or, you know, Hollywood depictions kind of devoid of politics. But the first robots were actually created and imagined in a time of absolute political turmoil. You just had the First World War, you know, it finished and had a devastating impact across Europe and so people will kind… and people are kind of reflecting on “What does it mean to be human”, “what makes us human” those kinds of question. And this kind of context is what inspired Capek to kind of write this play. And interestingly, these robots being human, they are actually in the play assembled on a production line, a bit like the Ford manufacturing production line. So even though they are human, they are assembled and these robots are designed to labour, and that is their primary purpose in society. 
039. In today's lecture, I'm going to talk about changes in air pollution since the middle of the last century and what has created these changes. So, um - by the 1950s, air pollution was very visible with frequent thick black fogs known as 'smogs' in many large cities around the world. The main source of this pollution was from factories and it caused severe health problems. For example, a particularly severe smog in London in 1952 caused over four thousand deaths. Obviously something had to be done and in 1956 a Clean Air Act was introduced in Britain. This addressed the pollution from factories and the smogs soon disappeared. However, as you know, these days air pollution is still a big issue. The main difference between now and the 1950s is that you can't see it - it's invisible. Also, the main source of pollution now is from cars and Lorries, and although these don't produce visible signs, this air pollution is still a significant risk to health. And one of the key factors in the rise of this type of pollution is that we have all become much more vehicle-dependent. There are far more cars and Lorries, trains and planes than in the 1950s and this is now the main source of air pollution around the world. 
040. So, it turns out the frogs like I mentioned before are incredibly diverse, so over 7000 species and many of them are nocturnal so they live, you know, they only come out at night but there are some that come out during the daytime and many of the ones that come out in the daytime have really bright colors and the blue frogs are the poison dart frogs is one type of blue. There are many blue frogs actually, but one type is called the poison dart frog and the reason they’re called that is because the native people in the Amazon who set in South America used to capture these frogs and take little darts and roll them on the skin of the frog and they’d use that to shoot the monkeys out of the trees, and it’s because these frogs are incredibly toxic. They have neurotoxins on their skin, so they wear their armour basically on the outside of their skin. One of the things that makes frogs or amphibians different from other vertebrates is that they have special glands that produce defensive compounds, mostly toxins that if something tries to bite them they get the toxin in their mouths and then what happens to that predator is that their muscles stop working so they literally can’t bite and they stop breathing. So, some of them are really dangerous actually and most of the ones that are dangerous are out in the daytime, so they’re flaunting their colours they have very bright either reds or blues or oranges and they’re basically showing off their poisonous nests in a sense. 
041. Today we’re going to recount heroic tales of superhuman feats of strength, when in the face of disaster, some people are said to have summoned up incredible physical power to lift a car off of an accident victim, move giant rocks, or like Big John of song, single-handedly hold up a collapsing beam to let the other miners escape. Are such stories true? There are many anecdotes supporting the idea, but we’re going to take a fact-based look at whether or not it truly is possible for an adrenalin-charged person to temporarily gain massive strength. In proper terminology, such a temporary boost of physical power would be called hysterical strength. The stories are almost always in the form of one person lifting a car off of another. In one case in Colorado in 1995, a police officer arrived at a single-car accident where a Chevy Chevette ended up on top of a baby girl and sank into the mud. The officer lifted the car and the mother pulled the girl out. In 2009, a man in Kansas lifted a Mercury sedan off of a six-year-old girl who had been trapped underneath when it backed out on top of her. In 1960, a Florida mom lifted a Chevy Impala so that a neighbor could pull out her son, who had become trapped when he was working on the car and his jack collapsed. There’s even the case where the MD 500D helicopter from Magnum, P.I. crashed in 1988, pinning the pilot under shallow water; and his burly friend (nicknamed Tiny) ran over and lifted the one-ton helicopter enough for the pilot to be pulled out. And, of course, the list goes on, and on, and on. In each of these cases, some aspect of leverage or buoyancy probably played some role in reducing the magnitude of the feat to something more believable. And even lifting many cars by several inches still leaves most of its weight supported by the suspension springs. But our purpose today is not to "debunk" any of the specific stories. The majority of them are anecdotal, and interestingly not repeatable; in many cases, the person who summoned the superstrength later tried it again only to find that they couldn’t do it. Basically, what we have is a respectably large body of anecdotal evidence that suggests that in times of crisis, danger, or fear, some people have the ability to temporarily exercise superhuman strength. 
042. In our survey, over a hundred CEOs who had recently been through an acquisition or merger were asked which areas of their activities needed the most effort. As you can see, the most frequent response to this question was that information technology requires the most effort. According to 58% of those we surveyed, IT was the most time-consuming and needed the most work. This is understandable as many of the IT issues are extremely complex and the consequences of any change in IT can have a significant impact. The key is how quickly and effectively IT integration can be achieved. And there has to be a clear understanding of the consequences there may be of not getting it right. The two other areas requiring significant attention: sales, marketing, and business development on the one hand, and financial management on the other both were selected by 49% of the respondents. 
043. All my research and that I conducted was my 60 plus graduate students, was motivated by their need to learn so that we can teach. Of course, in some inventions happened along the way but I've always considered the end result. And I always consider that this invention to be a by-product, by-products of the learning process. The end product for me was always better understanding or when one really succeeded in unifying theory that can help us in teaching the subject. I've also looked at teaching as a vehicle to try new ideas or new ways of doing things on an intelligent group of learners. That is as the vehicle for the teaching research results. And in my experience, this kind of teaching is the most stimulated and motivating to students. I am also uncovered many interesting research problems is the cause of teaching the subject. It is this unity of research and teaching their close connection and the benefits gathered by exercising and the interplay that to be recognized as the successful professor. 
044. You can see that the two charts, each give quite a different picture of the performance of boys and girls in the two key subjects of Maths and English. It shows that in English, girls consistently outperform boys over a period of 6 years, achieving scores about 10% above their male peers. There is quite a different picture when we look at the Math results with no real difference between genders in the results. What is the explanation for these key differences? To answer this question, researchers look at biological and cognitive factors and a range of social factors. The interaction between these different components in early childhood development are seen as maintained and reinforced in the school context. And this leads to distinct gender patterns of behaviour and skills with direct consequences for school performance and achievement. The ultimate uses of this evidence (are) to show that biological factors, such as patterns of cognitive developments are closely linked to social factor, such as learned gender categories. This cognitive skills are learned both pre-school and subsequently at school, supported by the responses of teachers, creating a reinforcement of patterns. 
045. Our friends at the Highlands Museum and Discovery Center in Ashland, Kentucky, asked a very good question. Why is it dark in space? That question is not as simple as it may sound. You might think that space appears dark at night because that is when our side of Earth faces away from the Sun as our planet rotates on its axis every 24 hours. But what about all those other faraway suns that appear as stars in the night sky? Our own Milky Way galaxy contains over 200 billion stars, and the entire universe probably contains over 100 billion galaxies. You might suppose that many stars would light up the night like daytime! Until the 20th century, astronomers didn't think it was even possible to count all the stars in the universe. They thought the universe went on forever. In other words, they thought the universe was infinite. Besides being very hard to imagine, the trouble with an infinite universe is that no matter where you look in the night sky, you should see a star. Stars should overlap each other in the sky like tree trunks in the middle of a very thick forest. But, if this were the case, the sky would be blazing with light. This problem greatly troubled astronomers and became known as "Olbers' Paradox." A paradox is a statement that seems to disagree with itself. To try to explain the paradox, some 19th-century scientists thought that dust clouds between the stars must be absorbing a lot of the starlight so it wouldn't shine through to us. But later scientists realized that the dust itself would absorb so much energy from the starlight that eventually it would glow as hot and bright as the stars themselves. Astronomers now realize that the universe is not infinite. A finite universe that is, a universe of limited size even one with trillions and trillions of stars, just wouldn't have enough stars to light up all of space. Although the idea of a finite universe explains why Earth's sky is dark at night, other causes work to make it even darker. 
046. During this time my goals are going to be to talk about the phenomenon that we may share impart with other animals, and our language and that is emotion. And also talk about some new technology, brain imagining, functional magnetic resonance imagining that we applied to try to answer some very old questions about how’s does motivation and emotion work. I’m going to present you with the scenario first, and some of you may be familiar with. This was developed by Pavlov over a century ago. And in this scenario, the dog is presented with the sound, the dog waits, and then it’ll see food powder and this happens repeatedly, things start to happen in the middle of what we’ve already understood point. Interesting things start to happen here. Pavlov’s study was salivation the dog, the salivation increases more time to paralyzes. But other things happened here too. You have a dog move around here more, all kinds of things are going on here. What we trying to capture was the experiment I’m going on to describe today is what is going on in the brain to generate that state which we called it Pavlov state. But you can also think about the state in terms of how the dogs’ feeling or, how your feeling is about before eating lunch today. 
047. Straight salary sales compensation plans aren't very common, but they do have a place in some organizations. With this type of structure, you'd pay your salespeople a straight albeit competitive salary like all of your other employees, and nothing else. No bonuses, no commissions, and few, if any, sales incentives. This type of compensation plan is most often used when the industry you operate within prohibits direct sales when salespeople work as part of small groups or teams and all contributions are equal, when your sales team is relatively small, or when your salespeople are expected to spend much of their time on other responsibilities other than selling. However, these plans don't tend to offer motivation to salespeople, as there are no incentives for them to work harder. The second plan is Salary plus Commission Salary plus commission sales compensation plans are possibly the most common plans used today. They're structured in a way that salespeople receive a lower base salary along with commission pay that makes up the majority of the total compensation. Organizations use salary plus commission sales compensation plans when there are opportunities to support all salespeople on this structure and when there are proper metrics in place for tracking sales to ensure that the splits are fair and accurate. This type of plan is often the better choice as opposed to straight salary because it offers motivation to increase productivity and to achieve goals. It also offers more stability. Salespeople will still get some types of pay even if they're in training when sales are low during certain months, or if market conditions get volatile. However, it can be more complex to administer. The third plan is Commission Only Commission only sales compensation plans are exactly what they sound like you pay your salespeople for the sales they bring in and nothing else. There is no guarantee of income. These types of plans are easier to administer than salary plus commission and provide better value for your money paid as they are based solely on sales achieved. They also tend to attract fewer candidates but do attract the most top-performing and hardest working sales professionals who know they can make a good income because they know how to sell. On the other hand, though, they can create aggression within your sales team and low-income security, which can lead to a high turnover rate and sales rep burnout from stress. 
048. Hello, I'm David Brown, curator of Italian and Spanish paintings at the National Gallery of Art. The treasures in our exhibition, The Art of Power, Royal Armor, and Portraits from Imperial Spain, come from the royal armory in Madrid. They range from the 15th to the 17th century and include some of the finest examples of Renaissance armor in the world. Fabricated by master craftsmen and artists, the flower of Spanish royalty. This is parade armor, made for show, not combat. In form, it looks back to a world tournaments, jousts, and noble gesture. And among the images worked into the steel is something quite different, a subtle advertising campaign for the imperial ambitions of the Spanish monarchy and the Hapsburg dynasty. Those who wore it took the words Holy, Roman, and Empire very seriously. 
049. Well, it’s about whether you can achieve a win-win solution, whether you can achieve economic growth which brings wealth in order to cut poverty without damaging biodiversity. And the argument is that if you want to protect biodiversity you have to focus on that as a goal. But if you do that, you have to run the risk of hurting the poor and you also run the risk of inconveniencing or reducing economic growth. We use the developed and industrialized countries to see this argument this axis argued about. With… let us say a government wishing to start drilling for oil in place X which is full of wildlife and the Wildlife Conservation Society is urging them not to… on the ground that it is a wilderness refuge. We use to that debate what I’m saying is it in the developing world there’s a third axis and it’s quite a complex one. 
050. There is a lot of interesting. What forms these clouds, why are these clouds there, why do they sort of stick around? At the center, every cloud drop has a particle. You can't grow a cloud drop without having a particle there for the water to condense on. The key question that people not directly address until very recently is what actually forms these clouds. So for once you’re looking out at over the ocean, turns out sea spray, sea salt is a very effective nucleus for forming clouds. So it's a really good chance that those are loaded with sea salt. But if you go inland, you start to have pollution come from all kinds of places, and so different sources form clouds more effectively than others, and we're trying to unravel which sources are actually contributing to the clouds. The clouds are incredibly important players in climate change, and that they reflect the white, they reflect the light back into space and so they’re keeping things much, much cooler than they would be if they weren’t there. They also play a huge role in regional weather, so in actuality, we’re starting to see shifts where having more pollution input into the clouds is affecting weather patterns, in particular, is actually reducing the precipitation so we’re starting to see drought in areas with super high levels of air pollution.

# Sample Answers:

033. Dog Growls

The lecture describes experiments showing that dogs can distinguish different types of growls. When playful growls or growls from a dog approached by a stranger were played, the dog still took the food. However, when the sound of a dog actively protecting its food was played, the dog backed off. These results suggest dogs understand the meaning and context of growls, not just the sound itself.

034. Chest X-ray and Biomedical Engineering

This lecture explains how a chest X-ray is an example of biomedical engineering. It applies the physical principle of how X-rays interact with body tissues to create images of internal organs. In the image, bones like the ribcage appear bright, the heart is clearly visible, and the lungs appear darker. This technology allows doctors to see inside the body without surgery.

035. Sigmund Freud

The lecture discusses Sigmund Freud, the most famous psychologist in history. Born in the 1850s, he spent most of his life in Vienna and later escaped to London during World War Two. Freud was not known for one single discovery, but for developing a comprehensive theory of the human mind over many decades, which strongly influenced modern psychology.

036. Leadership in Stickleback Fish

This study examined leadership behavior in stickleback fish. Researchers found that shy fish preferred to follow leaders with similar timid personalities, while bold fish followed any leader. However, bold fish still led more often because they initiated more movements. The study concludes that animals prefer leaders with similar personalities, but bold individuals may dominate through effort.

037. Music and Well-being

The lecture defines well-being as health, happiness, and the ability to thrive. Music plays an important role in managing well-being by calming, motivating, and healing people. Researchers aim to move from intuitive use of music toward informed community applications. Music already supports learning, social bonding, and emotional balance, and its potential benefits should be further explored.

038. Origins of Robots

This lecture explains that the first robots appeared in a 1920s play called Rossum’s Universal Robots by Karel Čapek. These robots were created during political turmoil after World War One. Unlike modern images of robots, they were designed as human-like laborers assembled on production lines, reflecting concerns about humanity, industrialization, and social change.

039. Changes in Air Pollution

The lecture compares air pollution in the 1950s with today. In the past, pollution from factories caused visible smog and serious health problems, such as the London smog of 1952. After the Clean Air Act, this improved. Today, pollution is mostly invisible and mainly caused by vehicles, making it harder to detect but still harmful to health.

040. Poison Dart Frogs

This lecture explains the diversity of frogs and focuses on poison dart frogs. These brightly colored frogs are toxic and use warning colors to deter predators. Their skin contains neurotoxins that can stop muscle movement and breathing. Unlike many nocturnal frogs, poisonous frogs are active during the day to display their danger clearly.

041. Hysterical Strength

The lecture examines stories of people showing extraordinary strength during emergencies, known as hysterical strength. Many examples involve lifting vehicles to save trapped victims. While factors like leverage reduce the actual weight lifted, there is strong anecdotal evidence that fear and adrenaline can temporarily increase human strength, even though the effect cannot be repeated later.

042. Mergers and CEO Challenges

This lecture presents survey results from CEOs after mergers. The majority said information technology required the most effort, due to its complexity and potential impact. Sales, marketing, and finance were also major challenges. The key message is that successful integration, especially of IT systems, is essential to avoid serious operational problems.

043. Teaching and Research

The speaker explains that their research was driven by teaching needs. Inventions were seen as by-products of learning rather than the main goal. Teaching was used to test new ideas, which helped motivate students and generate research questions. The lecture emphasizes the strong connection between teaching and research in successful academic work.

044. Gender Differences in Education

The lecture compares boys’ and girls’ performance in English and Math. Girls consistently outperform boys in English, while Math scores show little gender difference. Researchers suggest this results from both biological and social factors. These influences begin in early childhood and are reinforced in school, shaping learning behavior and academic outcomes.

045. Why Space Is Dark

This lecture explains Olbers’ Paradox, which questions why the night sky is dark despite billions of stars. If the universe were infinite, the sky should be bright. Scientists now know the universe is finite, so there are not enough stars to light all of space. Other factors also contribute, making the night sky even darker.

046. Emotion and the Brain

The lecture explores emotion using brain imaging technology like fMRI. Referring to Pavlov’s experiments, the speaker explains how anticipation creates emotional and physical responses before food appears. The research aims to understand what happens in the brain during this emotional state, helping explain motivation and emotional reactions in both animals and humans.

047. Sales Compensation Plans

This lecture explains three sales compensation models. Straight salary offers stability but little motivation. Salary plus commission is the most common, balancing security and performance incentives. Commission-only plans reward results but can cause stress and high turnover. Each plan suits different industries and sales structures depending on goals and team dynamics.

048. Spanish Royal Armor

The lecture introduces an exhibition of Spanish royal armor from the 15th to 17th centuries. These pieces were made for display, not combat, and symbolized power and imperial ambition. Crafted by master artists, the armor served as political messaging for the Spanish monarchy and the Hapsburg dynasty.

049. Economic Growth and Biodiversity

This lecture discusses whether economic growth can reduce poverty without harming biodiversity. In developing countries, this issue is complex because protecting nature may limit growth and affect the poor. The speaker explains that conservation decisions involve multiple competing priorities, making simple solutions difficult.

050. Clouds and Climate Change

The lecture explains how clouds form around particles such as sea salt or pollution. Clouds reflect sunlight and help cool the planet, playing a key role in climate regulation. However, increased pollution affects cloud formation and can reduce rainfall, leading to droughts. Understanding cloud sources is essential for climate and weather predictions.
