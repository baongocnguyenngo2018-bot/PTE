001. Our civilization, which subsumes most of its predecessors, is a great ship steaming at speed into the future. It travels faster, further, and more laden than any before. We may not be able to foresee every reef and hazard, but by reading her compass bearing and headway, by understanding her design, her safety record, and the abilities of her crew, we can. I think, plot a wise course between the narrows and bergs looming ahead. And I believe we must do this without delay. because there are too many shipwrecks behind us. The vessel we are now aboard is not merely the biggest of all time; it is also the only one left. The future of everything we have accomplished since our intelligence evolved will depend on the wisdom of our actions over the next few years. Like all creatures, humans have made their way in the world so far by trial and error, unlike other creatures. we have a presence so colossal that error is a luxury we can no longer afford. The world has grown too small to forgive us any big mistakes. 
002. Deliberate practice takes time and people also need to find and solve problems and mistakes during it. To be a high performing solo musician for the violin you also have to spend several dozen hundreds of hours in solitary practice. When it comes to other things, for example, studying geometry, it is still the case. During practice you should identify your weakness, focus on it, and carry out further deliberate practice to demonstrate how important deliberate practice is. Even for talents, they generally need spend ten years to achieve the high international level of recognition. So there is no need for average people to be ashamed to practice. 
003. Morton Prince was an American physician and psychologist, his book 'Dissociation of a Personality' was the best-seller at that time. It tells a story of Miss Christine Beauchamp, who was suffering from MPD (Multiple Personality Disorder). Miss Christine Beauchamp has several types of personalities, namely B1, B2 and B3. There was hidden memory in these three personalities, with hallucination among them. Miss Beauchamp was B2. B2 knows about B1, B3 knows both B1 and B2, but B1 knows nothing about B2 or B3. The strongest personality accounts for most of the time and it will take over the others and become the main personality at the end. This case and theory gives great help to crime investigation. 
004. The biotech engineering has undergone three phases. In the first phase, people designed and made some simple machines, which aimed to help people understand ourselves. And first group of people that realized we could learn from ourselves were engineers. And then, based on the studies, people began to make complicated devices, in order to cure wounds, like the practice of suture, and to study physiology. This is the second phase. Later, since we went into the third phase, more complicated machines have been developed, like ECG (electrocardiography), able to have an insight of your internal body without intruding it, which can show the human brain's functions. X-ray is a good example. In an X-ray picture, you can see the bright area is the heart with some vessels around, and the dark area is the lungs. These devices benefit humans greatly in solving health problems, such as diseases. 
005. Happiness comes from frequency and quality of social relation. The higher the frequency is, the more happiness relations with friends and family and others produce. It is not sure why social relation is correlated with happiness. But there’s evidence that when people feel more satisfied with their social relations, they will feel happier, in turn, when people feel happier, they will get more satisfied with social relations. Happy people tend to be social more with friends and have more interaction between family. Some people wonder if their social activities make them happier or their happy personalities drive them to be social more with their friends and families. 
006. Female: Which one are you going to write more in your book, science or scientists? 
Male: I do want very much to write something about science, actually. So I prefer to scientists. 
Female: All right. What's interesting in scientists then? 
Male: Science is just like complex furniture, which is all about evidence. But scientists can tell stories, do researches and propose questions to find what is true. They are like a focal point. They are always in interesting situations. 
Female: Whether science or scientists your book mainly about, it seems to be rather hard for general readers to understand, doesn't it? 
Male: I don't think so, really. In fact the book I write is a science fiction, which is related with science but is not strictly scientific. So you don't have to have a PhD degree in physics or other disciplines to understand a science fiction. And loving science is very different from being a scientist, which means fiction writing is not the same as writing scientific journals. When scientists fail, they will question the situation about why they have failed. But as a fiction writer, I don't have to. In my book, you can always see stories about 'happy family'. 
007. The British press came into existence in the 18th century, a time of great change and progress. Since then, it has played a pivotal role in shaping public opinion and discourse. Freedom of speech, a cornerstone of democratic societies, has been encouraged by British policy from the very beginning. This freedom allowed people to discuss anything and everything in public places, such as coffee houses or on the streets. These public spaces became hubs of intellectual exchange, where newspapers were read and issues of the day were debated. Topics ranged from politics and government policies to military matters, reflecting the diverse interests of the public. This open dialogue is a testament to the freedom enjoyed by the public. But the story doesn't end there. The British press has evolved with time, embracing new technologies and adapting to changing societal norms. Today, it continues to inform, educate, and provoke thought, reaching millions of readers through print and digital platforms. Moreover, the British press plays a crucial role in holding power to account. It scrutinizes government actions, champions the rights of the marginalized, and shines a light on issues that matter. In conclusion, the British press, with its rich history and commitment to freedom of speech, is more than just a news source. It's a symbol of public freedom, a watchdog of democracy, and an integral part of British society.Thank you for listening.
008. Let's unfold the realm of 'Literature' and its profound impact on society. Literature is not just an escape; it's a mirror that reflects our realities, a lens that sharpens our worldview. Literature fosters empathy. When we dive into the narratives of characters from diverse backgrounds, we live a multitude of lives. This vicarious experience enriches our understanding of others, bridging gaps across cultures and experiences. Furthermore, literature is a catalyst for social change. It has the power to challenge norms, to question policies, and to push boundaries. The works of authors like Harriet Beecher Stowe and George Orwell have spurred movements and reformed societies. As we engage with literature, let us recognize its role in shaping the contours of society. In the pages of books, we find the seeds of the future, sown with words that can move nations. 
009. For too long, discussions about climate change have been about sacrifice. I am here to tell you that climate solutions actually make a better city and a better quality of life for everyone. This is only the first of five lessons we have learned on our journey to become an emission-free city. And I think these lessons can be applied almost anywhere. So I like to share them. So lesson number one, confronting climate change is about creating better cities and better quality of life for everyone, including those kids in the kindergarten, that don’t have to share their days with noisy excavators. The second lesson is about being ambitious. In 2015, the city council set a target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 95 percent by 2030 without purchasing any carbon offsets. So aiming for real reductions. Commitment to this goal changed our mindset. If we were going to reach this target, every department had to get active, figure out measures and finding out how to implement them. So second lesson, be ambitious. A target measured in years, not decades, provides no excuse for inaction. 
010. In this lesson, we discuss the similarities and differences between the eukaryotic cells of your body and prokaryotic cells such as bacteria. Eukaryotes organize different functions within specialized membrane-bound compartments called organelles These structures do not exist in prokaryotes. Your body's composed of trillions of cells - lots of different types of cells that make up different organs and other parts of your body. Your body is also where 10 times that number of bacteria call 'home sweet home.' But don't be afraid - these bacteria do more good than harm to you. And besides, just in case you wanted to strike up a conversation with your tenants, you and your bacteria do have a few things in common. All cells share some common characteristics that make them living things. All organisms are composed of cells, the basic fundamental unit of life. They contain DNA as a heritable genetic material, and they can reproduce. They transcribe DNA into RNA and translate RNA into proteins on ribosomes. They can also regulate transport across a cell membrane and require chemical energy for some cellular processes. Organelles are the biggest difference between bacteria and cells that make up the human body Organelles
011. I think with our linguistic training we also get all this invisible training to be authorities, to be the people who know. It is part of that process that you come out as a world authority on your chosen subject. But when we move into working with communities, we have to recognize that the communities have to be the authority in their language. Actually, a woman in the class I'm teaching at Sydney at the moment, a career woman, expressed this very nicely, although she was talking about something else, she was distinguishing expertise from authority. And certainly linguists, because of the training we do, have expertise in certain very narrow areas of language, but we don't have the authority over what to do with that knowledge or what to do with other knowledge that the community produces. I guess for me the bottom line is languages are lost because of the dominance of one person over another. That's not rocket science, it's not hard to work that out. But then what that means is if in working with language revival we continue to hold the authority, we actually haven't done anything towards undoing how languages are lost in the first place, so in a sense, the languages are still lost if the authority is still lost.
012. The impact on young Australians who are interested in buying a home of their own has been very significant. Australia's housing affordability now shapes the typical housing cycle or housing career as some people call it. Most Australians in the normal course of events are people who move through the housing cycle in a way that matches the stages of life that they're at. So, they move out of the family home in their late teens or early 20s as they gain their independence from their families, then they rent to save for a home they can afford as either a group or maybe a couple. And maybe they can upgrade it when they have a family in their middle age, they are more than likely to have paid off their mortgage. And that means they have housing security in their old age. That's no longer the typical housing cycle for Australians, young people generally live at home for much longer than they once did. They generally rent for longer and they're more likely to be saddled with a mortgage not just into their middle age but more often than not into their retirement as well. In fact, in 2006, 65,000 retiree households were still paying off the mortgage. Affordable rent is also an elusive right around Australia. We have very low rental vacancies, we see high turnover as landlords want to maximize their profits in a tight market, and we see less long-term or lifelong rental, as we see in other countries and other economies.
013. It's time for this young loggerhead turtle to go to work. We can tether turtles in these little clock harnesses put them into this tank and they'll swim in place. University of North Carolina biologist Canelo men study see turtles that are programmed from birth for an extraordinary journey. The mother turtles bury the eggs on the beach and then returned to the sea and the eggs hatch about 50 to 60 days later. The support for National Science Foundation Lomond is learning how these reptiles use the earth's magnetic field to navigate 5 to 10-year journey around the Atlantic Ocean. The turtles seem to inherit a set of responses that tell them what to do when they encounter specific magnetic fields at particular locations. This animal magnetism can be a lifesaver one field off Portugal triggers the turtles to turn south if they don't they'll likely die swept into frigid North Atlantic waters in one lab test turtles responded to magnetic field similar to what they would encounter off the coast of Florida the great majority of them turned southeast. Now, this is an exciting finding because south-easterly orientation in this part of the world would presumably take turtles further into the Gulf Stream so the turtles actually have what might be considered a crude Global Positioning System that is based on the earth's magnetic field. And check out this experiment these turtle moves may look odd. The turtles will actually act out there swimming behavior in air. But this wave simulator recreates the first environmental cue hatchling turtles respond to. And to swimming into waves is a highly reliable trick the turtles use to guide themselves up short.
014. Loggerhead turtles are the most abundant of all the marine turtle species in U.S. waters. But persistent population declines due to pollution, shrimp trawling, and development in their nesting areas, among other factors, have kept this wide-ranging sea-goer on the threatened species list since 1978. Their enormous range encompasses all but the most frigid waters of the world's oceans. They seem to prefer coastal habitats, but often frequent inland water bodies and will travel hundreds of miles out to sea. The largest of all hard-shelled turtles leatherbacks are bigger but have soft shells loggerheads have massive heads, strong jaws, and a reddish-brown shell, or carapace. Adult males reach about three feet in shell length and weigh about 250 pounds, but large specimens of more than 1,000 pounds have been found. They are primarily carnivores, munching jellyfish, conchs, crabs, and even fish, but will eat seaweed and sargassum occasionally. Mature females will often return, sometimes over thousands of miles, to the beach where they hatched to lay their eggs. Worldwide population numbers are unknown, but scientists studying nesting populations are seeing marked decreases despite endangered species protections.
015. Can we never get to absolute zero? What a wonderful question. I wish I had a wonderful answer to go with it. Here is the problem, there is actually a law of physics called the third law of thermodynamics, that says you cannot get to the absolute zero, but we don't really know it's true, but we are pretty sure it is for the following reason: every time you think of some way of cooling something down a little bit, it means you try to get energy out of that thing and make the temperature lower. Well if you can get energy out, usually there is a way that the energy can go in as well. And that always means there is a competition between taking the energy out and putting the energy in. Now you can try to make it, so you are favoring getting energy out, but you can't completely stop the energy from going in and that means you might be able to get colder and colder, but you won't be able to get all the way to absolute zero. Could we go back to my PowerPoint, because I think that one of these slides will illustrate that point a little bit better? Yes, here, remember the logarithmic thermometer? There is no zero on this logarithmic thermometer, just keeps going down, you make it a fact of 10 colder, you're not a zero. You make it a fact of 10 colder, you're still not a zero. You make it a fact of 10 colder, you're still not a zero. So, you start a million of a degree, now you are 10 millions of a degree, now you are 100 millions of a degree. Now you are billions of degrees. You never get to zero that way. You get closer and closer, but you never get to zero. So that's why we cannot get to absolute zero.
016. On this illustration often used is the one that the monkeys and the typewriters. Ok, we have a monkey sitting at a typewriter and the claim here is basically if you leave chance in time long enough you will get a life, don't worry about it, yes, its's strange, yes, it's wonderful, but leave enough matter 600 million years on earth and you will have life. So, the monkey sifting at the typewriter the chances are eventually he produces the complete works of Shakespeare so what's the problem. But he doesn't manage to do it in 600 million years. So, what I decided to do is to run the numbers. I, instead of saying typing the complete work of Shakespeare, I just run the numbers for how long would it take a monkey typing one key striker a second. To type to be or not to be that is the question'. Right? On average how long is it gonna take my monkey friend one keystroke a second? I don't know how you think it would be. Maybe you could have a guess. Would it be less or more than 600 million years, which is the period life on earth isn't supposed to have emerged within and when I run the numbers" to be or not to be is the question' takes 12.6 trillion trillion trillion trillion years to type just that phrase and a DNA string has got as much as information the encyclopedia Britannica? Are we saying that something of that complexity emerges by chance undirected within 600 million years? Again, it's mathematically possible but it's so incredibly unlikely that it would have that it tilts me in favor of the Christian story in which God created life, simply a question of saying let that be and there was. 
017. The way a mother rat takes care of its pups is by licking and grooming, nipple switching an arch back nursing. So the rats that do a lot of licking and grooming and their last rats that rule very little. But most rats are in between. So that resembles a human behaviour as well, right you have mothers that are highly mothering and mothers that couldn't care less and most mothers are somewhere in between. So if you look at these rats. So all you do you observe them and put them in separate cages. So you put the high lickers in one cage not the mothers, but the offspring and the low lickers in another cage and then you let them grow and they're adults now, their mothers are long buried and you look in the brain and you see that those who had high licking mothers express a lot of glucocorticoid receptor, gene and though so our lawmakers express to know that reflects a number of factors and that results in a different stress response, but this is not the only difference. We found, later on, there are hundreds of genes that are differently expressed. So if you get in a mutation, you know polymorphism once in a million. Here, just the motherly launching just hundreds of genes in one shot and it changes them in a very stable way that you can look at the old rat and you can say whether it was licked or not. But you can also save by behaviour. So if you walk to the cages to the room the rats that were poorly lit are highly anxious, hard to handle, aggressive and the rats that were very well handled as off as little pups. They are much more relaxed much easier to handle. So you know, like every technician in the lab knows to look at the adult rat how it was licked when it was a little tough any question of course. mechanism. how does this work? 
018. This busy little town is named after St. David's first cousin. It's also a Welsh language stronghold. According to the 2001 census results, seventy percent of the town's population could speak Welsh but even here the language may not be completely safe. The Welsh language board expects last year's census results to show a fall in the number of Welsh speakers living in its northern and western heartlands. One of the main reasons for that the board says is migration. Many Welsh speakers are choosing to leave the country. At the same time, only a small percentage of those moving in can speak the language or choose to learn it. Historically, over the past 1788 Wales people have continually left in order to find better standard of pay maybe in quality of employment and the things have change was probably is that them there is a larger amount of English people now who have found Wales of the last 20-25 years particularly this corner of Wales and regarded is a desirable place to come and live and as opposed to many areas in England and cheaper as well.
019. But there was no modern lit Wilson came then from a different world and he became the focal point of a broad mainstream American culture that thought that modern literature and wanted modern literature to be able to be read and appreciated by ordinary people, they were not modernists in an abstract sense and certainly some of them like TS Eliot and Faulkner were too difficult for some of their writings to be read by ordinary people, but this was a world before the division between the brows or between a lead or whatever had established itself as part of our consciousness. Wilson was a major player in the successful effort of his generation to establish at the heart of American life and innovative literature that would equal the great cultures of Europe. And he knew that the great cultures of Europe were there he was not a product of a narrow American Studies kind of training at all. He joined a high artistic standard with an openness to all experience and a belief that literature was as much a part of life for everyone as a conversation. He thought that Proust and Joyce and Yeats and Eliot could and should be read by ordinary Americans and helped that to happen. Wilson was a very various man over a period of almost 50 years. He was a dedicated literary journalist, an investigative reporter, a brilliant memoirist, and a dedicated journal keeper.
020. As Joanne pointed out only one country tiny little Bhutan wedged between China and India has adopted the gross national happiness as the central index of government policy and actually has had a good deal of success in education and in health and in economic growth and in environmental preservation and they have rather sophisticated way of measuring the effects of different policies on people's happiness but they're the only country to go that far but you're now beginning to get other countries interested enough to do kind of white paper policy analyses about whether happiness research what effects would it have we used it more for public policy you're beginning to get to countries like Australia, France, Great Britain that are considering pushing regular statistics on happiness so it's beginning to become a subject of greater interest for policymakers and legislators and different advanced countries.
